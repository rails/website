  SerpApi’s API, frontend, and background jobs run on Ruby on Rails. Their Rails app is a majestic monolith, deployed on a cluster of AWS EC2 instances from their automation scripts from CI. SerpApi relies on a wide range of gems including *Mongoid*, *Sidekiq*, *Redis*, *Puma*, *Stripe-Rails*, *Airbrake*, *AWS SDK*, *HTTP.rb*, *Nokogiri*, *Nokolexbor*, and *Geokdtree*. For frontend development, the team uses *ERB*, *jQuery-Rails*, and *React-Rails*.

pull_quote: "We at SerpApi deeply appreciate the simplicity and developer experience that Rails provides. It powers our API that unifies data from Google, Amazon, and over 100 other search engines into a single API call. We’re proud to support the Rails Foundation and the Ruby on Rails community as it continues to evolve, grow, and inspire developers around the world."
