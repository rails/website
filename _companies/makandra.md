intro: |
  makandra is a Rails consultancy based in Germany. Since 2009, it has delivered over 200 custom web applications across the full software lifecycle — from requirements and UI/UX to development, operations, and maintenance. Clients range from small businesses to global enterprises. Notable projects include [Siemens SiESTA](https://makandra.de/en/siemens-38) (cybersecurity testing), [JustClaims](https://makandra.de/en/justclaims-34) (air passenger claims), [Audi MediaCenter](https://makandra.de/en/audi-mediacenter-31) (press hub), [GREENZERO](https://makandra.de/en/greenzero-179) (LCA platform), [JUUUPORT](https://makandra.de/en/juuuport-368) (online youth counseling), and [Studyflix](https://makandra.de/en/studyflix-39) (video learning platform).
  <br><br>
  makandra often maintains applications long-term — some since 2010 are still in active use. From this commitment emerged [Rails LTS](https://railslts.com/), a service providing security patches for legacy Rails versions, compatible with modern Ruby. On the infrastructure side, a dedicated DevOps team hosts and manages Rails apps on makandra-owned hardware in a German data center.

  Around 95% of customer applications developed by makandra are built using Ruby on Rails.
  <br><br>
  Most makandra applications follow a monolithic architecture with heavy namespacing, using mostly RSpec and capybara-lockstep for testing and PostgreSQL as the default database. Frontend development prioritizes progressive enhancement with Unpoly, though React and Angular are used when needed. Deployments rely on Linux VMs with Capistrano, leveraging OpsComplete, their in-house hosting platform, provides Rails-specific automation for provisioning and deployment.
  <br><br>
  In addition, makandra maintains a significant number of internal Rails applications that support daily operations — including tools for CVE tracking, project management, billing, hot desking, lunch booking, secret sharing, knowledge management, private LLM chat, and more.

  **Recruiting**
  - Recruiting Ruby developers has historically been a challenge, especially in a smaller city like Augsburg. makandra addressed this by creating a [trainee program](https://makandra.de/en/trainee-program-84) where university graduates learn Ruby on Rails and related technologies over a nine-month period before joining client projects. Combined with a strong culture of mentorship and continuous learning, this program has helped build a large team of experienced engineers over the years.
