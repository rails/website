  Fleetio’s customer-facing web application — which powers the majority of the business logic — is built on Ruby on Rails. Rails serves as both the foundation for their core web experience and the backend API that supports their mobile applications. The company runs a monolithic architecture, which allows them to move quickly, keep complexity low, and maintain a high level of cohesion across the product. Fleetio’s choice of Rails stems from its speed in prototyping, ease of use, reliable functionality, and a vibrant community that aligns well with their MVP and experimentation approach.

  Fleetio relies on a variety of well-established gems, including ActsAsTenant for multitenancy, Sidekiq for background job processing, Devise for authentication, and RSpec for testing. Rails’ conventions and ecosystem enable Fleetio’s engineering team to focus on delivering customer value rapidly rather than wrestling with boilerplate setup or infrastructure overhead. This approach has allowed the company to iterate quickly, validate ideas, and evolve the product while keeping their codebase maintainable. These qualities have given Fleetio an edge in their industry, and over time, Rails has proven to be a great fit for their scrappy, product-driven culture.

pull_quote: "Rails is core to Fleetio’s DNA. While we embrace many of its strengths, the community is by far the most important. We owe much of our success to that community, and for years we’ve looked for meaningful ways to give back. The Rails Foundation gave us that opportunity, and becoming a core founding member is our way of supporting and strengthening the ecosystem that’s helped us thrive."
