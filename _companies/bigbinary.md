intro: |
  BigBinary is a development firm with over 13 years of experience specializing in Ruby on Rails. BigBinary has a track record of building high-quality software and was an early adopter of Ruby on Rails due to its exceptional productivity. Over the years, clients like **Gumroad**, **MLB**, **AngelList**, **Rootly**, **AtoB**, and **Healthicity** have worked with them to build robust, scalable software. In addition to client work, BigBinary is also building Neeto — a suite of productivity tools — entirely using Ruby on Rails.

  As a Ruby on Rails consulting company, BigBinary tailors its approach based on the architecture and requirements of each project. Their engineers have implemented both **Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)** for a modern, server-driven UI and **React.js** for more dynamic, client-heavy interfaces. On the backend, we’ve worked extensively with **Sidekiq** and are now also leveraging **Solid Queue** for Active Job-based background processing. We also integrate tools like **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Elasticsearch** to build scalable, high-performance systems on top of Rails.
pull_quote: "At BigBinary, we all love working with Ruby on Rails, and find it incredibly productive. Without it, it wouldn’t be possible for us to build Neeto, where we are building 20+ products simultaneously. We are thrilled to be part of the Rails Foundation. We believe Rails has a great future ahead and we want to do our bit to make that a reality."
