name: Renuo
intro: |
  Renuo is a Web Agency based in Zürich, Switzerland. They have built with Rails since their foundation, and the framework is what represents their competitive advantage over other agencies in the Swiss market.<br><br>
  Renuo automates and simplifies processes. This can only be achieved through the right balance between innovation and stability. Innovation is brought in every single project, adapting the single technologies and libraries to the customers' needs. Stability is brought by Rails.<br><br>
  Since their founding, Renuo has relied on open source, which is why they joined the Rails Foundation. In addition to supporting open source, they donate 10% of their profits to charity each year.

  Since 2011 Renuo has not only used the framework but also contributed to the ecosystem of libraries and the community. For all their 50+ customers, they have built great Rails monoliths. Rails has been a great companion in building API-Only backends, client-server web applications with modern Javascript Frameworks which are heavy Javascript Single Page Applications, and most recently Turbo and Stimulus HTML-Over-The-Wire Server-Side-Rendered apps.<br><br>
  But the people at Renuo also like to have their custom flavours, that's why they have a custom renuocop styling guide, rely on Postgres and GoodJob, RSpec and always a good set of System Tests that run on the side. The company also provides a PaaS in Switzerland called deplo.io.<br><br>
  Rails is omakase, but it's also a big tent for different tastes!

pull_quote: "We want to contribute to the longevity of Rails. Every day, a new project is bootstrapped using Ruby On Rails, and we’d like to provide a more basic angle to the future development of Rails. We come from a small agency’s point of view and want to influence the formal and cultural groundwork as a small player.<br><br> We also feel strongly about education. Our vision? To see Ruby on Rails in universities."
