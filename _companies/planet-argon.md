name: Planet Argon
intro: |
  Planet Argon is a [software consultancy](https://www.planetargon.com/?utm_source=rubyonrails.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rails_foundation_profile) known for inheriting and revitalizing existing Ruby on Rails applications, helping organizations turn legacy systems into long-term assets rather than liabilities. Founded in 2002, they’ve been working with Rails since the beginning, long enough that their name is [hardcoded into the Rails source code](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/afd3591a475e7da28fa958bfe5a203d466d5c27f/actionview/test/fixtures/companies.yml#L11).

  They've worked on hundreds of Rails applications across industries, from Nike, Sequoia Capital, Disney, and Oregon State University. Their clients often maintain essential Rails applications that don’t require a full-time engineering team but still demand consistent support and expertise.

  Planet Argon helps organizations stabilize and modernize their Rails applications, improving performance, reducing risk, and extending the value of their existing investments. Whether serving as a [long-term technical partner](https://www.planetargon.com/services/staff-augmentation?utm_source=rubyonrails.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rails_foundation_profile) or providing [flexible augmentation](https://www.planetargon.com/services/fractional-software-development?utm_source=rubyonrails.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rails_foundation_profile) alongside internal developers, they help teams avoid the risks of relying on limited in-house capacity and keep applications running smoothly.

  Planet Argon supports teams already committed to Rails, whether helping them finally gain traction on upgrading that old Rails 2.3 app, introducing Hotwire, or integrating with common JavaScript frameworks depending on project needs. After working on hundreds of Rails apps, they’ve seen nearly every generation of tooling come and go.

  Their engineers focus on making applications more sustainable, understandable, and resilient to future change, improving deployment workflows, stabilizing test suites, and guiding teams through architectural transitions.
pull_quote: "Ruby on Rails has long been regarded as an excellent tool for startups and makers. Our delightful clients benefit from the contributions of the Ruby on Rails community, which enables small teams to achieve big goals.<br><br>After learning about the Rails Foundation’s goals and upcoming plans, we asked how we could join the mission. This investment is less an attempt to plant new seeds but rather to help improve the maintainability of an already flourishing garden.<br><br>We believe in a blossoming future for Ruby on Rails. All Aboard!"
