  Shopify is the industry's premier proof that a "Majestic Monolith" can scale to support the global economy. During Black Friday 2025, Shopify's Rails monolith powered **$14.6 billion** in merchant sales, handling peak loads of **489 million requests per minute** on the edge and over **53 million database queries per second**. Rather than fracturing into microservices to handle this volume, Shopify scales its massive codebase, and its 3.1k+ engineers, by treating the development environment as a product.
  
  To maintain this velocity, the team invests heavily in development tooling utilizing **Ruby LSP** for top-tier editor intelligence, running on **Edge Rails** to leverage the latest framework features immediately, and using **Maintenance Tasks** to safely manage complex data backfills and migrations without downtime. Additionally, significant improvements in Ruby performance are achieved through the development of new compilers (such as **YJIT** and **ZJIT**) and concurrency primitives, ensuring the monolith remains performant on modern hardware.

pull_quote: "Rails has been core to Shopify’s ability to build and ship commerce at massive scale, and we want to help ensure the framework stays a great choice for the next generation of developers. Supporting the Rails community and the Rails Foundation is a practical investment in the health of the ecosystem - better docs, better learning resources, and better community events - so Rails can keep evolving alongside how production systems are actually run today."
