intro: |
  Cedarcode specializes in deploying high-performance Ruby on Rails engineering teams for startups and industry leaders that need to scale fast without compromising quality. With a collective 15 years of deep expertise in the Rails ecosystem, Cedarcode has earned the trust of companies like Airbnb, BetterUp, Underdog Fantasy, Amgen, and ID.me, among others.
  <br><br>
  **How Cedarcode works**<br>
  Cedarcode Rails teams integrate seamlessly into existing engineering setups, helping businesses build, scale, and evolve their products with agility. They ramp up in weeks, without the hassle of traditional hiring, providing the flexibility to scale up or down as business needs change. Their focus is on quality, reliability, and building long-term partnerships, collaborating with clients for years to ensure ongoing growth and innovation.
  Cedarcode’s passion for security led them to develop webauthn-ruby, an authentication gem used to implement passkeys in ruby, trusted by some of the biggest Rails shops in the industry.

  The vast majority of the backend applications Cedarcode works with are built on Rails. It’s their framework of choice and the one Cedarcode recommends to their partners for scaling steadily and building fast.<br><br>
  For Cedarcode-specific applications, including all the tooling around their webauthn-ruby ecosystem, they are running the latest Rails versions. Deploys are handled by Kamal, and some internal apps have been transitioned to Hotwire.
pull_quote: "We firmly believe that Ruby on Rails is the best tool for building the web. It empowers us to create complex systems successfully while enjoying the process. More importantly, it provides everything needed for others—including solo developers—to test and turn their ideas into reality. This is what makes Ruby on Rails so powerful, and why we are committed to investing in it. As a company, we wanted to actively contribute to the framework’s evolution and longevity. Our goal is to help ensure that developers can continue to thrive with Rails for many years to come."
