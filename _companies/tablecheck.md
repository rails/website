  TableCheck uses the latest version of Rails for their core monolith, which powers both their online restaurant booking and in-restaurant management app. They also use it for various microservices such as payment processing, typically using REST APIs to serve JSON to a React or Ember.js frontend. They use many libraries, such as Mongoid (instead of ActiveRecord) to connect to MongoDB. They also use Devise, Omniauth, Prawn PDF, Paperclip and maintain over 30+ smaller gems themselves. In addition they use Elixir and Python in our stack for various needs.
