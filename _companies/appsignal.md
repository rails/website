intro: |
  AppSignal is the APM built for Rails developers. Bootstrapped and founded in Amsterdam, AppSignal started as a small tool before "APM" was even a buzzword. They have now grown into a complete monitoring solution. From error tracking and performance insights to logs and more, it all works right out of the box.

  AppSignal prides itself on the simplicity of its tool and affordability for teams of all sizes, from hobbyists and startups to SMEs and beyond. Today, it helps thousands of developers ship code faster and catch issues before their customers even notice.

  AppSignal has been powered by Rails since commit one and continues to rely on the framework today. Rails powers the core of AppSignal’s monitoring tool.  Their Ruby integration provides first-class Rails support, making installing AppSignal in Rails applications a breeze.

  Thirteen years later, AppSignal is still working in Rails every day. The framework allows their small development team to ship quickly, maintain focus, and build features they’re proud of. AppSignal’s Ruby gem has accumulated over 4,000 commits from more than 60 contributors and is currently on its fourth major version, with continuous improvements in each release.
pull_quote: "Without Rails, we wouldn’t be able to build AppSignal the way we do, leveraging the power of the framework and its community. By joining the Rails Foundation, we want to play our part in helping new and existing developers discover, learn, and enjoy working with the framework that made us."
