One of the primary goals of the [Rails Foundation](/foundation) is to improve the Rails documentation for both new and existing users. We have a lot of ideas about how to achieve this, and we are now ready to start tackling this with the help of an experienced UX designer and a technical writer (or two) with a strong Rails background.

These two roles will have a lot of opportunity for cross-collaboration to find (and close) gaps in the current content. Both roles will also work closely with members of the Rails Core and Issues team as well as volunteers from the Rails community to understand the needs and pain points of Rails users. 

Here are some of the projects that you could be working on:
- Updating the look and feel of the Rails guides template.
- Creating a Learn path with user-friendly tutorials for new Rails users.
- Creating a page of case studies highlighting how companies use and scale with Rails.
- Creating a navigation bar that works across all Rails web properties.
- Designing the space where video tutorials could live on rubyonrails.org.
- Designing the landing/starting page for all documentation (guides, tutorials, learn, API, etc)

So: are you passionate about UX design? Do you have a knack for simplifying complex information? Are you a long-time fan/user of Rails? If so, read on.

__Freelance UX Designer__

The focus of this role will be on improving the user experience of our existing online resources and helping the technical writers organize information in a logical and user-friendly manner. We have a number of small projects on both the marketing and documentation sections of rubyonrails.org that need the attention of an experienced UX designer, and we are willing to take our time to find the right person. 

While this is not a full-time role, we would like this person to become our go to UX designer on an ongoing, per-project basis, so we will start small. We will discuss the greater picture and our ideas, as well as possible beginning projects with the right candidates.

Responsibilities:
- Prototyping: Create interactive prototypes using HTML & CSS to visualize and test design concepts before implementation.
- UX Design: Design aesthetically pleasing and consistent layouts that enhance the readability and comprehension of technical content.
- Implementation: Work closely on the development and launch of each project.

Requirements:
- Proven experience as a UX designer with a strong portfolio showcasing your design process and solutions. Bonus if you can show experience reorganizing a large collection of legacy documentation.
- Familiarity with Ruby on Rails is a huge plus.
- Proficiency in HTML and CSS for prototyping (we prefer seeing it live over Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, etc).
- Strong communication skills to articulate design decisions and gather feedback effectively.
- Legally set up as a freelancer/independent contractor.

__How to Apply:__

To apply for the freelance UX designer position, please submit your resume, portfolio, and a brief cover letter explaining your interest and relevant experience. We will review applications on a rolling basis until Oct 15, 2023. 

As this is a freelance role, your proven experience will drive our decision. Shortlisted applicants will be invited for a call where we can answer any questions you have, and discuss potential start projects and timelines so that you can deliver a proposal and give an indication of your rates.

__Freelance Technical Writer__

We are looking for one or two technical writers that we can work with on a regular basis to update the documentation and guides, create tutorials, draft social posts, and write use cases for rubyonrails.org. You'll work closely with the UX designer to create space for a learning path for new Rails users, and ensure that the Rails documentation is informative, engaging, user-centric, and easy to find. 

This is not a full-time role. We are looking to work one or two writers on a regular, recurring freelance basis. 

Responsibilities could include:
- Content Creation: Produce clear and concise documentation, tutorials, guides, and use cases related to Rails development and updates. Collaborate with Rails Core, UX designers, and community members to understand technical concepts and translate them into accessible content.
- Social Media: Create an ongoing series of engaging social media posts to highlight recent updates to the Rails framework, Rails best practices, and tips & tricks.
- Code Examples: Create code examples and demos that illustrate key concepts and best practices to be used in tutorials and social posts.
- Information Architecture: Work with the UX designer to organize information in a logical and user-friendly manner.
- Usability Testing: Gather feedback from the community to improve the clarity and effectiveness of documentation.

Requirements:
- Strong programming experience with Ruby on Rails.
- Proven experience in technical writing, with a portfolio showcasing your ability to explain complex technical topics in an easy to read, clear style.
- Legally set up as a freelancer/independent contractor.
