<p><a href="http://www.collaboraid.biz">Collaboraid</a> recently had a visit with their client on that major intranet project for the still concealed client. Here they learned just <a href="http://www.collaboraid.biz/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=43285">how much of a difference</a> it makes to work in a truly productive environment:</p>
<blockquote>Yon, my colleague, would demo the work-in-progress to someone, and&mdash;as expected&mdash;we&#8217;d uncover some room for improvement here and there. But what turned out to be really fascinating was that most of the time, I was able to fix the problem on the spot, and we could re-test the improved version 10 minutes later.<br /><br />Larger things, we&#8217;d do in out hotel rooms later that same night (after dinner and drinks with the client, of course). That&#8217;s what the power and productivity of Rails is like. In addition to just saving time, it also helps spur people&#8217;s imagination in constructive ways, when they see the kinds of changes that are possible on the fly like that.</blockquote>
<p>Collaborative development and participatory design have long been the hallmarks of the Scandinavian school of software development. How wonderful to see it practiced using Rails.</p>
