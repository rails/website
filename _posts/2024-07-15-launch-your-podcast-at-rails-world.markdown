The Rails Foundation has exciting news: After last year's success <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com">Buzzsprout</a> is once again sponsoring the [Rails World](/world) Podcast program - only this year we are adding a fun new element. 

If you've always wanted to have your own podcast, now is the time. Buzzsprout, the world's largest premium podcast hosting platform built on Rails, wants to help you one lucky would-be podcaster launch their podcast at Rails World.

With 1,000 attendees from around the world, and a lineup of some of our industryâ€™s [best speakers](/world/2024/speakers), it is a unique opportunity for podcasters to meet, interview, and connect with other community members at Rails World - all under one roof.
