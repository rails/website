<p>Editor Andreas Ahlenstorf would like to print an article on Rails in the Swiss IT magazine InfoWeek:</p>
<blockquote>I&#8217;m looking for somebody who would like to write an article about<br />
Ruby on Rails for the swiss IT magazine InfoWeek, best one of Rails&#8217;<br />
core developers :). The article must be written in german, so it<br />
would be helpful if it&#8217;s somebody from Switzerland, Germany or even<br />
Austria. Do you know one person in your team who&#8217;s predestinated to<br />
do that?</blockquote>
<p>Do you know Rails? And can write a readable German? Then get in <a href="mailto:rails-iw@sopic.com">contact with Andreas</a> right away and help him increase the awareness of Ruby on Rails in Switzerland.</p>
