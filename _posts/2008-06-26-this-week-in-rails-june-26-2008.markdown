<p>Welcome to the second edition of This Week in Rails, a weekly report with highlights from the Rails community.</p>
<h4>Ruby Vulnerabilities</h4>
<p>As <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2008/6/21/multiple-ruby-security-vulnerabilities">previously reported</a> by Jeremy Kemper, serious vulnerabilities have been discovered for the main Ruby implementations. The <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/06/20/arbitrary-code-execution-vulnerabilities/">official advisory</a> suggests an upgrade path, but there have been several reports of segmentation faults when using Rails with the patched Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 versions. The Phusion team has published <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/assets/r8ee-security-patch-20080623.txt">a patch</a> for Ruby 1.8.6-p111, but as things stand now, it hasn&#8217;t been included by the Ruby core team (yet).</p>
<p>If you are using Rails 2.1, Ruby 1.8.7-p22 seems the way to go. Unfortunately, Ruby 1.8.7 is not compatible with previous versions of Rails. If you decide that it&#8217;s time to upgrade your applications to Rails 2.1, <a href="http://rails.learnhub.com/lesson/page/2433-upgrading-non-trivial-apps-to-rails-21">this article</a> features some handy tips, while <a href="http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/6/19/gotchas-when-upgrading-to-rails-2-1">this other one</a> warns you about a few gotchas.</p>
<p>Those of you who&#8217;re running a version of Ruby that shipped with Mac OS X should wait for the next Apple&#8217;s Software Update.</p>
<h4>Ajax</h4>
<p>Rails is opinionated software, but its support for plugins clearly demonstrates a certain openness to diverging opinions on non-core issues. So while most of us mainly use Protoype, it is fairly common to see folks adopting other JavaScript frameworks as well, particularly jQuery.</p>
<p>Last week Jim Neath published <a href="http://jimneath.org/2008/06/18/using-jquery-with-ruby-on-rails/">a nice overview</a> which compares jQuery with Prototype, and provides information about using jQuery with Rails through the jRails plugin.</p>
<p>Whatever your Ajax framework of choice is, you may be interested in the new <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/">Google Ajax Library <span class="caps">API</span></a> to improve the performance of your applications. Thanks to the tutorial <a href="http://www.strictlyuntyped.com/2008/06/using-google-ajax-libraries-api-with.html">Using Google Ajax Libraries <span class="caps">API</span> with Ruby on Rails</a> (soon to be incorporated into a plugin) you can start adopting the <span class="caps">API</span> with Rails right now.</p>
<h4><span class="caps">MVC</span></h4>
<p>Rails 2.1 adds named scopes, which greatly simplify writing &#8220;find logic&#8221; within your Active Record models. It&#8217;s an extremely useful feature which is well explained in this write-up aptly titled, <a href="http://www.pathf.com/blogs/2008/06/named-scopes-are-awesome/">Named Scopes Are Awesome</a> (we agree). Checkout also Ryan Bates&#8217; railscasts on the subject: <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/108">named_scope</a> and <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/112">Anonymous Scopes</a>. You may also be interested in this week&#8217;s railscast about <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/115">Caching in Rails 2.1</a>.</p>
<p>Three other compelling Active Record related posts were, <a href="http://www.dcmanges.com/blog/smart-model-dumb-controller">Smart Model, Dumb Controller</a>, <a href="http://rubypond.com/articles/2008/06/18/bulk-insertion-of-data-with-activerecord/">Bulk insertion of data with ActiveRecord</a> and <a href="http://blog.stonean.com/2008/06/timestamped-migrations.html">Timestamped Migrations</a> on how to make &#8220;classic migrations&#8221; an available option (see <a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/446-make-timestamped-migrations-optional#ticket-446-3">ticket</a>).</p>
<p>Michael Bleigh published <a href="http://www.intridea.com/2008/6/23/subdomainfu-a-new-way-to-tame-the-subdomain">a tutorial</a> about dealing with subdomains in Rails applications through the SubdomainFu plugin (which appears to be flexible and very straightforward to use).</p>
<p>XP programming practices such as Test-Driven Development are very popular within the Rails community, but there are still many developers who see testing as a chore. Josh Nichols wrote an overview called <a href="http://technicalpickles.com/posts/a-walk-through-of-test-driven-development-with-shoulda">A walk through of test-driven development with shoulda</a> that shows you how easy it is to apply <span class="caps">TDD</span> to your Rails projects. In this specific case, he adopted the <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda">Shoulda</a> plugin which seamlessly adds some assertions, helpers and macros on top of the Test::Unit framework.</p>
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>Aside from <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org">api.rubyonrails.org</a> there are <a href="http://www.railsbrain.com/api/rails-2.1.0/doc/index.html">many</a> <a href="http://gotapi.com">alternatives</a> for quickly visualizing the documentation of the Rails&#8217; <span class="caps">API</span>. Last week a new one was launched: <a href="http://rails-doc.org">rails-doc.org</a>. The current version features rapid searches and user annotations. This last feature in particular has the potential to become truly useful.</p>
<h4>Deployment</h4>
<p>If you are using Apache and mod_rails, you may want to read <a href="http://www.drogomir.com/blog/2008/6/18/upload-progress-bar-with-mod_passenger-and-apache">this article</a> which provides information about a newly released module called <a href="http://github.com/drogus/apache-upload-progress-module/tree/master">apache-upload-progress</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Jason Crystal wrote a tutorial for <a href="http://blog.jasoncrystal.com/?p=7">packaging Rails applications for offline use</a> on Mac OS X 10.5.</p>
