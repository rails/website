<p>There is a vulnerability in the escaping code for the form helpers in<br />
Ruby on Rails.  Attackers who can inject deliberately malformed unicode<br />
strings into the form helpers can defeat the escaping checks and inject<br />
arbitrary <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
<pre>
Versions Affected:  2.0.0 and *all* subsequent versions.
Not affected:       Applications running on ruby 1.9
Fixed Versions:     2.3.4, 2.2.3
Candidate CVE:      CVE-2009-3009
</pre>
<h4>Impact</h4>
<p>Due to the way that most databases either don&#8217;t accept or actively<br />
cleanse malformed unicode strings this vulnerability is most likely to<br />
be exploited by non-persistent attacks however persistent attacks may<br />
still be possible in some configurations.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong> users of affected versions are advised to upgrade to a fixed versions.</p>
<h4>Releases</h4>
<p>The 2.3.4 and 2.2.3 releases will be made available shortly and contain fixes for this issue.</p>
<h4>Patches</h4>
<p>In order to provide the fixes for users who are running unsupported<br />
releases, or are unable to upgrade at present we have provided patches<br />
against all affected stable release branches.</p>
<p>The patches are in a format suitable for git-am and consist of two<br />
changesets.  The code for cleansing multi-byte strings, and the<br />
introduction of that code to the relevant helpers.</p>

</ul>
<p>Please note that only the  2.2.x and 2.3.x series are supported at<br />
present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade<br />
sooner rather than later as we cannot guarantee that future issues will<br />
be backported in this manner.</p>
