Rails is the framework it is today thanks to the work of over <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/">7,000 contributors</a> who have shaped the framework through countless lines of code, features, and fixes.

**The Rails Luminary Awards** exist to celebrate those contributions, acknowledging those in the community who have significantly advanced Rails for the benefit of all.

If you know of someone who has consistently gone above and beyond to contribute to the framework, triaging bugs, improving performance, adding helpful features, etc. please nominate them for the 2025 Rails Luminary Award.

All nominations will be reviewed by Rails Core, and the final pick of Rails Luminaries will receive an award for their service, as well as a monetary award of $1,000.

Submit your 2025 Rails Luminary nomination <a href="https://rails-foundation.neetoform.com/8b24d6a3780dcd7c9381">here</a> before December 3.
