Hi everyone!

Before the year wraps up, while everyone is planning their 2026, we wanted to share some quick information about **Rails World 2026** in case that is on your conference wishlist next year (and we hope it is!).

**Quick overview**

- Dates: September 23 & 24, 2026 (Wed & Thurs)
- Location: Palmer Event Center (very central Austin)
- CFP: open Q2/early spring 2026

**Tickets**

We adjust Rails World attendance to our chosen venue in each city, and since everything is bigger in Texas, that means we will have space for **1,200** attendees: the largest Rails World yet. 

Tickets will be released in Q2 2026. We will have the same ticket tiers as before:
- **Corporate Tickets** - pre-released; for when your company wants to send your team and you can use an L&D budget, or if you wish to support the event further.
- **General Admission Tickets** - subsidized heavily by the Rails Foundation and released at a later date.

Ticket cost is determined by a number of factors, not least of all sponsorship sales (more on that below), so we are still narrowing down the 2026 ticket prices. This is our first US event, and it’s generally more expensive to produce in the US, so I do expect a small increase from previous years. However, we’re doing our *utmost* to keep costs down and ticket prices affordable for those paying out of pocket.

Like in previous years, we will supply letters of invitation for ticket holders who need them. Instructions on how to request one will be sent in the confirmation when you buy your ticket. 

**Rails at Scale Summit**

The Rails at Scale Summit is a day of open discussion about scaling Rails applications where engineers working on high-performance, high-traffic systems connect. Last year was the first edition, and it was a success, so we’re doing it again.

The summit will take place the day before Rails World, on September 22nd, and is a separately ticketed event. It will once again be an invite-only event based on an application, with a separate CFP for Summit talks.

**Sponsor Rails World**

Sponsorship sales are now open. Join us as a Rails World sponsor to connect with the Rails community, showcase your brand or product, and help shape the future of Rails. We have a lot of fun packages this year, and a lot of ideas that we would love to bring to life. 

Becoming a sponsor is also a great way to guarantee tickets for you or your team well in advance, and there are a number of low-lift sponsorships this year that allow you to attend the event if you prefer not to man a booth.

Download the prospectus <a href="https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/gr3BsVx9mBmfJzN36rjaprRs">here</a>, and get in touch if you want to chat: <a href="mailto:sponsors@rubyonrails.org">sponsors@rubyonrails.org</a>.

**That’s it for now.** 

We’re excited about Austin, and if you've never been...we can’t wait to show you why.

Keep an eye on the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/world/">website</a> for updates, or sign up to <a href="https://rails-foundation.kit.com/sign-up">this event-specific mailing list</a> to be kept informed. 
And you can also always reach out at <a href="mailto:world@rubyonrails.org">world@rubyonrails.org</a>, I’d love to hear from you.
