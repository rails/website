We are excited to welcome <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> as a **Platinum Sponsor** for [Rails World 2024](/world/2024), taking place in Toronto on September 26th and 27th. As a Core member of the Rails Foundation and a key player in the global developer community - not to mention the Ruby community - GitHub’s participation and support means a lot to us.

>Sixteen years since GitHub’s inception, and at the heart of every product and ship still lies our community – those coding from nearly every corner of the world. Our continued partnership and now sponsorship with Rails World is an extension of not just our commitment to developers, but our deep belief in what the developer community can accomplish for the betterment of mankind. 
>
> Rails World is a unique space for developers and all who create with code to ideate on novel ideas, sharpen their skills, and build what’s next for Rails and software at large. And at GitHub, that’s what we’re all about.

Rails World attendees can find GitHub at their booth in the Sponsor Garden - be sure to stop by for a chat with the team. GitHub is also giving away fantastic prizes in the daily raffle, including <a href="https://www.thegithubshop.com/1542211-00-github-skateboard-deck">GitHub skateboard decks</a> and copies of the <a href="https://www.thegithubshop.com/1536824-00-art-of-the-octocat-book">Art of the Octocat book</a>, a favorite among developers and GitHub fans alike.

As part of their sponsorship, GitHub will be hosting Track 1, one of the two main stages at Rails World 2024 where you’ll also find the day’s opening and closing keynotes and fireside chat, and the daily giveaways.

To host their track, GitHub nominated Rebecca Miller-Webster, Director of Software Engineering for Codespaces/Copilot Workspace. Having organized the Write/Speak/Code events for 9 years and the GoRuCo conference (RIP) for 2 years, Rebecca brings a wealth of event expertise and is excited to chat with the Rails community in the breaks on Track 1, so be sure to say hi.
