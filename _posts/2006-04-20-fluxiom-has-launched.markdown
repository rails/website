The wait is over for the next killer Rails application. <a href="http://fluxiom.com">Fluxiom</a> has launched! Digital asset management just got a lot sexier.</p>
<p>You may have seen its <a href="http://fluxiom.com/video">demo video</a> which has been floating around since last December. Developed by <a href="http://www.wollzelle.com/">wollzelle</a> with none other than <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/">Thomas Fuchs</a>, aka <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Mr. Scriptaculous</a>, at the helm, it brings a native desktop app feel to your web browser. Those building Rails applications these days may be familiar with all the swanky effects Thomas has been putting together. Turns out he&#8217;s had a few tricks up his sleeve. Fluxiom not only helps collect, manage and access your assets, it does it with style.</p>
<p>Fluxiom provides four subscription levels, all of which offer a free 30 day trial. You can <a href="http://fluxiom.com/video">check out the video</a> and then head over to the <a href="http://fluxiom.com/pricing/">sign up page</a>.</p>
<p>We await a bevy of great extractions Thomas ;)</p>
