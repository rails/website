We have been getting a lot of questions about Rails World 2024 in Toronto, so here is an update of everything we can share right now.

[Rails World](/world/2023) (full website coming soon) will take place September 26 & 27, 2024 in Toronto, Canada. We hope to welcome 1,000 attendees to the second edition. 

**Sponsorship sales are now open.** 

Join us as a Rails World sponsor to connect with the Rails community, showcase your brand or product, and help shape the future of Rails. 

<a href="https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/xuZrxDiHj7vQbFzATqz8U8gc">Download the prospectus here,</a> and let's make Rails World 2024 an event to remember! 

**The venue.**

We have secured a fantastic venue: <a href="https://www.evergreen.ca/evergreen-brick-works/">Evergreen Brickworks</a>. 

Evergreen Brickworks is a former brick factory with a lot of character surrounded by nature. It is run by a non-profit, and proceeds from events like Rails World help fund their sustainability work in the surrounding community and across Canada.

We are excited to transform such an amazing space into the next Rails World for you.

**Start preparing your CFP now.**

Our goal is to have the CFP open in February 2024. 

If you have an idea for a talk, we recommend working on the proposal now. Like last time, we will be looking for highly technical, forward-thinking talks that highlight the competitive advantage of Rails, share best practices, or push the boundaries of where Rails can go.

We would like all speakers confirmed by the time tickets go on sale.

**Registration.**

We are going to flip the script this year, and will not be issuing Early Bird tickets. 

Producing an event in North America is a lot more costly than in Europe, but we want Rails World to remain an affordable conference. So when they go on sale, General Admission tickets will cost $559 (US dollars). 

Before that, we will release a limited number of Support tickets at a higher price (price TBD). This is so that any community members who are able to pay a bit more can help offset the cost for others. 

This is an experiment. These Support tickets, combined with sponsorships, and the annual funding from the Rails Foundation members, are the reason we will be able to keep Rails World affordable for the general public. 

We do not have a projected date for ticket releases yet.

**Choice of 3 hotels.**

We have secured rates at three hotels in Toronto, all of which vary from approximately $246 to $352 (US dollars) per night. For your convenience, we will be running shuttles to the venue from two of the hotels. Attendees who register will receive information about how to book with their confirmation.

**More info coming soon.**

That's all of the details that we can share for now. We will work on getting a website up soon, and will share more information about the CFP as soon as possible.
