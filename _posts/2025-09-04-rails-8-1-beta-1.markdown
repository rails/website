Rails 8.1 represents the work of [over 500 contributors](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/edge/contributors) across 2500 commits in the last ten months since our last major release, and we're thrilled to time the first beta release with the first day of Rails World. Here are a few of the highlights:

## Active Job Continuations

Long-running jobs can now be broken into discrete steps that allow execution to continue from the last completed step rather than the beginning after a restart. This is especially helpful when doing deploys with Kamal, which will only give job-running containers thirty seconds to shut down by default.

Example:

```ruby
class ProcessImportJob
  include ActiveJob::Continuable

  def perform(import_id)
    @import = Import.find(import_id)

    # block format
    step :initialize do
      @import.initialize
    end

    # step with cursor, the cursor is saved when the job is interrupted
    step :process do |step|
      @import.records.find_each(start: step.cursor) do |record|
        record.process
        step.advance! from: record.id
      end
    end

    # method format
    step :finalize

    private
      def finalize
        @import.finalize
      end
  end
end
```

Active Job Continuations was lead by Donal McBreen from [37signals](https://37signals.com).

## Structured Event Reporting

The default logger in Rails is great for human consumption, but less ideal for post-processing. The new Event Reporter provides a unified interface for producing structured events in Rails applications:

```ruby
Rails.event.notify("user.signup", user_id: 123, email: "user@example.com")
```

It supports adding tags to events:

```ruby
Rails.event.tagged("graphql") do
  # Event includes tags: { graphql: true }
  Rails.event.notify("user.signup", user_id: 123, email: "user@example.com")
end
```

As well as context:
```ruby
# All events will contain context: {request_id: "abc123", shop_id: 456}
Rails.event.set_context(request_id: "abc123", shop_id: 456)
```

Events are emitted to subscribers. Applications register subscribers to
control how events are serialized and emitted. Subscribers must implement
an `#emit` method, which receives the event hash:

```ruby
class LogSubscriber
  def emit(event)
    payload = event[:payload].map { |key, value| "#{key}=#{value}" }.join(" ")
    source_location = event[:source_location]
    log = "[#{event[:name]}] #{payload} at #{source_location[:filepath]}:#{source_location[:lineno]}"
    Rails.logger.info(log)
  end
end
```

Structured Event Reporting was lead by Adrianna Chang from [Shopify](https://shopify.com).

## Local CI

Developer machines have gotten incredibly quick with loads of cores, which make them great local runners of even relatively large test suites. The [HEY](https://hey.com/) test suite of over 30,000 assertions used to take over 10 minutes to run in the cloud when counting coordination, image building, and parallelized running. Now it runs locally on a Framework Destkop AMD Linux machine in just 1m 23s and an M4 Max in 2m 22s.

This makes getting rid of a cloud-setup for all of CI not just feasible but desireable for many small-to-mid-sized applications, and Rails has therefore added a default CI declaration DSL, which is defined in `config/ci/rb` and run by `bin/ci`. It looks like this:

```ruby
CI.run do
  step "Setup", "bin/setup --skip-server"
  step "Style: Ruby", "bin/rubocop"

  step "Security: Gem audit", "bin/bundler-audit"
  step "Security: Importmap vulnerability audit", "bin/importmap audit"
  step "Security: Brakeman code analysis", "bin/brakeman --quiet --no-pager --exit-on-warn --exit-on-error"
  step "Tests: Rails", "bin/rails test"
  step "Tests: Seeds", "env RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:seed:replant"

  # Requires the `gh` CLI and `gh extension install basecamp/gh-signoff`.
  if success?
    step "Signoff: All systems go. Ready for merge and deploy.", "gh signoff"
  else
    failure "Signoff: CI failed. Do not merge or deploy.", "Fix the issues and try again."
  end
end
```

The optional integration with gh ensures that PRs must be signed off by a passing CI run in order to be eligible to be merged.

The local CI work was lead by Jeremy Daer from [37signals](https://37signals.com).

## Markdown Rendering

Markdown has become the lingua franca of AI, and Rails has embraced this adoption by making it easier to respond to markdown requests and render them directly:

```ruby
class Page
  def to_markdown
    body
  end
end

class PagesController < ActionController::Base
  def show
    @page = Page.find(params[:id])

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.md { render markdown: @page }
    end
  end
end
```


## Command-line Credentials Fetching

Kamal can now easily grab its secrets from the encrypted Rails credentials store for deploys. This makes it a low-fi alternative to external secret stores that only needs the master key available to work:

```bash
# .kamal/secrets
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(rails credentials:fetch kamal.registry_password)
```

Work by Matthew Nguyen from [Shopify](https://shopify.com) and Jean Boussier.

## Deprecated Associations

Active Record associations can now be marked as being deprecated:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts, deprecated: true
end
```

With that, usage of the `posts` association will be reported. This includes explicit API calls like

```ruby
author.posts
author.posts = ...
```

and others, as well as indirect usage like

```ruby
author.preload(:posts)
```

usage via nested attributes, and more.

Three reporting modes are supported (`:warn`, `:raise`, and `:notify`), and
backtraces can be enabled or disabled, though you always get the location of the
reported usage regardless. Defaults are `:warn` mode and disabled backtraces.

## And Everything Else

With 2500 commits since the last release, there's a ton of fixes, minor features, and improvements included in Rails 8.1 as well. Please have a look at the CHANGELOG files for details.
