<p>From the <a href="http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com/">Bratwurst on Rails</a> team:</p>
<blockquote>Fellow Rubyists from Berlin cordially invite all participants of RailsConf Europe to a barbecue in good old German tradition. The event is an opportunity to socialize and meet the conference participants in a relaxed atmosphere, and to make your name or brand known amongst them. Members of the Berlin Ruby Usergroup will take care of your stomach, and drinks will be available at fair prices.<br/><br/>The venue will be in the heart of Berlin, close to the conference venue. Entry will be free, as will the food. (If you’re interested in sponsoring, have a look at our sponsoring packages and feel free to contact the organisation board via sponsoring@bratwurst-on-rails.com). Your bratwurst awaits you!</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s happening September 1st.</p>
