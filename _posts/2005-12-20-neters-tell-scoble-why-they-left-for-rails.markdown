<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Robert Scoble is <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/12/19/i-made-phil-ripperger-stand-in-line-for-an-xbox-360/">concerned about the exodus of developers</a> like Phil Ripperger that are leaving .<span class="caps">NET</span> for Ruby on Rails. Phil put it like this:</p>
<blockquote><i>Scoble, as a web developer who is now doing freelance work for a living, my framework of choice is Ruby on Rails. Mostly for the reasons listed <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/01/ross-doesnt-trust-microsofts-approach-to-web/">here</a>. And also because Microsoft&#8217;s web development technologies have lost their appeal. I can remember being blown away by <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> when I first saw it. I now feel even more strongly about Rails. And when I talk to businesses and friends who are developers, I make sure they know about Rails.<br/><br/> Sure, I know about the new Visual Studio, <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> 2.0, the new SharePoint, and the new <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server. And I just don&#8217;t care. Microsoft needs to capture some of the 360 magic and use it on their web development technology or they will continue to lose developers like me.</i></blockquote>
<p>Scoble is inviting people to tell him and Microsoft why .<span class="caps">NET</span> and family just isn&#8217;t doing it for them any more. If you have a good story to share, do let them know.</p>
