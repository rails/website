<a href="http://wiseheartdesign.com/">John Long</a> has announced the initial release of <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a>, the simple and elegant <span class="caps">CMS</span> that is planned to eventually power the <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/redesign2005/">redesigned</a> reincarnation of the official Ruby website, <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">ruby-lang.org</a>.</p>
<p>You can take a look at some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86701100@N00/sets/72057594122572739/">screenshots</a>, check out the <a href="http://radiantcms.org/demo/">demo</a>, read   the <a href="http://dev.radiantcms.org/">source</a>, subscribe to the <a href="http://radiantcms.org/mailing-list/">mailing list</a>, and follow along on the <a href="http://radiantcms.org/blog/">weblog</a>.</p>
<p>Underneath the sheets, John is using his custom templating library <a href="http://radius.rubyforge.org/">Radius</a>, on top of which he&#8217;s implemented his so called <a href="http://radiantcms.org/blog/2006/05/02/behaviors/">Behaviors</a>. To help you dig into such features, John has provided some starting points for <a href="http://dev.radiantcms.org/#LearningRadiant">learning Radiant</a> as well as a <a href="http://radius.rubyforge.org/files/QUICKSTART.html">quickstart for Radius</a>. If you want to jump aboard and help the development, he&#8217;s providing some tips on  <a href="http://dev.radiantcms.org/#Contributing">how you can contribute</a>.</p>
<p><code>svn co http://dev.radiantcms.org/svn/radiant/trunk/radiant/</code></p>
<p>Things called a <span class="caps">CMS</span> are notoriously complex. Cheers for keeping it simple.</p>
