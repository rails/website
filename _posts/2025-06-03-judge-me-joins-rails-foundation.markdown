The Rails Foundation is pleased to announce that Judge.me is joining the Rails Foundation as our newest Core member, joining <a href="https://cookpad.com/">Cookpad</a>, <a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a>, <a href="https://www.fleetio.com/">Fleetio</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a>, <a href="https://www.procore.com/">Procore</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>and <a href="https://37signals.com/">37signals</a>.

Judge.me is a product reviews platform built with Ruby on Rails at its core. Founded in 2015, the company has grown to support more than 500,000 e-commerce shops across 140+ countries. Every month, Judge.me processes over 70 million orders and generates more than 2 million verified buyer reviews. 

Rails has been the foundation of Judge.me’s product since the very beginning. As the platform scaled globally, Rails has remained central to delivering the performance, reliability, and speed that Judge.me relies on.

Headquartered in London, Judge.me also supports the broader Rails ecosystem through community engagement. The company is a proud sponsor of the local London Rails meetup, contributing to spaces where developers can connect, share knowledge, and strengthen the community around the framework.

We’re also welcoming <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linh-dam-48a55641/">Linh Dam</a>, Co-Founder and Chief Architect of Judge.me, to the board. Born and raised in Vietnam, Linh began working on Judge.me in early 2015 and he has remained deeply involved in the platform’s technical direction ever since.

Earlier this year, Linh led a full upgrade of Judge.me’s monolith, migrating the application through every major Rails version from 4.2 to the latest 8.0 and Ruby version from 2.7 to 3.4 – all in under four months. The upgrade was executed incrementally in production, with zero downtime, across a live platform serving over half a million merchants. This effort modernised a large and complex codebase, improved performance and security, and unlocked the latest framework features.
It’s a reflection of Linh’s hands-on leadership and of what’s possible when experienced teams commit to keeping Rails at the heart of a fast-scaling product. 

> Rails has always been the default choice at Judge.me. We started the company with Rails on day one, and for the past 10 years, it has remained the core of our stack. We love everything about Rails, the framework, its philosophy, the rich ecosystem, and the passionate community behind it. 
> Becoming a member of the Rails Foundation is a true privilege. It’s our way of giving back and contributing to the growth of a community we deeply believe in. More people around the world should get to know Rails and experience the joy of building with it.”

This marks the final addition to the Core member group for now. We’re incredibly grateful for the support of these ten companies along with all of our Contributing members, and we look forward to all we’ll continue to build together.

You can meet all these companies and more at Rails World this September.
