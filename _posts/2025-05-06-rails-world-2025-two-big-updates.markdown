Hey everyone!

The [Rails World 2025 website](/world/2025) has been updated, and here are a few big updates you should know about this year’s event.

<img src="/assets/images/banner-RW25-tickets.png">

**New ticket types, prices and release schedule**

This year we will have two ticket types: Support tickets and General Admission tickets.

**New:** We’re introducing a limited batch of **Corporate Support tickets**, available for €899. These pre-released tickets, while still partially subsidized by the Rails Foundation, are ideal if your company wants to send your team and can use an L&D budget. Support tickets play a key role in making Rails World possible and also help keep General Admission tickets affordable for community members paying out of pocket. As a thank you for supporting the event, we’ll recognize your name (or your company’s name) during the opening session at Rails World. **Support tickets are already available. <a href="https://rails-foundation.neetoform.com/6c170cd8bdedc4b16ec0">Book yours here</a>.**

**General admission tickets** will go on sale on **May 13th at 5pm CEST**, and will be priced at €499. The general admission tickets are greatly subsidised by the Rails Foundation, and they tend to sell out quickly. Don’t forget to sign up to the <a href="https://rails-foundation.kit.com/sign-up">event mailing list</a> to receive a reminder on the day itself.

**Also new this year: Rails at Scale Summit**

**<a href="https://rubyonrails.org/world/2025/rails_at_scale">Rails at Scale</a>** is a new event taking place on September 3, the day before Rails World. It’s a full day of open discussion focused on scaling Rails applications, a chance for engineers working on high-performance, high-traffic systems to connect and exchange insights, best practices, and hard-earned lessons.

The event is sponsored and hosted by **Shopify** and is invitation-only, capped off with a happy hour for attendees.

At Rails at Scale, you can expect to:

- Learn from engineers who have scaled Rails in production
- Share your own insights during open discussions
- Connect with engineers solving similar challenges at other companies
- Chat with the Rails Core team, Committers, and Issues team about your specific challenges

We encourage applications from anyone working with Rails at scale. Space is limited, and applying does not guarantee an invitation. To ensure broad participation, we’ll also limit the number of attendees from each company. Please apply once on behalf of your company and indicate how many team members you’d like to send.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccZfVsoc3O4UfG6CnJETT1Kfux8FdOIBriGFfsOE4L4X1Iww/viewform">Apply here</a>.

That’s it for now! Check back soon when we’ll announce our amazing speaker lineup, and for those waiting for General Admission tickets, don’t forget to mark your calendars on Tuesday, May 13th.

Regards,

Amanda & Gaia 

**PS**: We are still accepting Rails World sponsors, so if your company would like to guarantee tickets for your team, please get in touch at sponsors@rubyonrails.org.
