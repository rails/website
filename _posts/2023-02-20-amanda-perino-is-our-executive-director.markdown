Since announcing [the formation of The Rails Foundation](/2022/11/14/the-rails-foundation) in November, we've been busy finalizing all the formalities of incorporation, and running a diligent search for the foundationâ€™s executive director. We're thrilled to announce that all those formalities have now been handled, and that we've found our executive director! Please welcome <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandabrookeperino/">Amanda Perino</a> to the job of leading our mission to improve the documentation, education, marketing, and events in the Rails ecosystem.

Amanda joins us after spending years at HashiCorp as a senior manager for events and experiential marketing. Previous to that, she spent twelve years in marketing roles across several industries. In her career, she's organized conferences, led marketing efforts, commissioned film productions, and managed social media campaigns. She has led many efforts that line up exactly with the skills she'll need in the role as executive director of the Rails Foundation. On top of all that, she's a recent graduate of a Rails bootcamp! Just perfect.

We asked Amanda to share a few words about the opportunity: "Long before I worked in tech, I first heard about the concept of 'community' by those who used the term specifically in relation to the Ruby on Rails community. Now, years later, I am excited to devote my time to helping support and grow that same community. I look forward to discovering ways to strengthen the Ruby on Rails ecosystem so that those who rely on it can continue to do so for decades to come.".

With everything in place to start work on our actual mission, we hope to soon have news to share about the first official Rails conference to be organized by the foundation this year. We also look forward to commissioning work on documentation, education, and ramp up the general marketing for Rails with additional social media engagement and more.

We are excited to welcome Amanda. We have a lot of work to do, and we can't wait to get started.
