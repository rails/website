Cześć! I'm [Emmanuel](https://hayford.dev), and I have some updates for you from Rails.

[Log a warning if ActiveSupport::Cache is given an expiration in the past](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45842)
Imagine trying to write/fetch to/from a cache and the operation fails silently because _expires_at_ is in the past... a debugger's nightmare. This PR helps. You won't get an error raised, instead, you'll get "Cache expiration is in the past" in your logs.

[Define and raise error if legacy_connection_handling= is called from an app](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45835)
[In Rails 6.0](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/40370) if you switched to a role, say _reading_, then all database connections would also switch to that role. In Rails 6.1 however, you could set _legacy_connection_handling_ to _false_ to disable this behaviour. _legacy_connection_handling_ was removed in Rails 7 without setting it to _false_ by default, causing an error. This PR fixes that by redefining _legacy_connection_handling_ and raising an error.

[Fix ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#in_order_of to work with nils](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45670)
This PR fixes an issue where an invalid SQL is generated when _nil_ is passed to _in_order_of_.

[Rescue EOFError error from rack on a multipart request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45833)
_EOFError_ is added to the list of rescued errors that can arise from a multipart POST request, raising a _ActionController::BadRequest_ exception and rendering a _400 Bad Request_ instead of _500 Internal Server Error_.

[Add description of breaking changes and the deprecation cycle to guides](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45831)
This PR clarifies the deprecation cycle. This is mostly to help contributors but a good addition to the documentation nonetheless.

We had [11 contributors](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20220812-20220817) since last week.

That's it. Do zobaczenia!
