üëãüèæ... This is [Emmanuel](https://hayford.dev/). I've got some Rails updates for you.

[Rack 3.0 has shipped](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/3.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)
A major version of Rack has shipped, and as expected, there are breaking changes but with lots of improvements and an [upgrade guide](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/main/UPGRADE-GUIDE.md). There's also a [changelog](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) of the beta versions and release candidates leading up to the release.

[Rails 7.0.4, 6.1.7, and 6.0.6 have been released
](https://rubyonrails.org/2022/9/9/Rails-7-0-4-6-1-7-6-0-6-have-been-released)These are mostly bugfixes with various enhancements, compatibility fixes, and performance improvements.

[Fix bug in connection handler methods using all pools](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45924)
_active_connections?_, _clear_active_connections!_, _clear_reloadable_connections!_, _clear_all_connections!_, and _flush_idle_connections!_ now operate on all pools by default. Previously they would default to using the _current_role_ or _:writing_ role unless specified.

[Add :locals to ActionView rendering instrumentation](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45977)
Action View render instrumentation now reports _:locals_. _ActiveSupport::Notifications_ will now capture _:locals_ in addition to _:identifier_ and _:layout._

[Add ability to run only before/around/after callbacks in run_callbacks
](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45952)This PR makes it possible to use _run_callbacks_ without the need to run all callbacks. You can now choose specific callbacks to run.

[ActionDispatch::Cookies JSON deserializer discards Marshal dumps](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45956)
If an application reads a Marshall dump, _JSON::ParserError_ is raised without clearing cookies when the cookies serializer is set to JSON. This PR fixes that.

[35 people](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20220902-20220910) contributed to Rails in the last 8 days.

That's it. –î–æ–ø–æ–±–∞—á–µ–Ω–Ω—è!
