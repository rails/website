<p>Obie Fernandez and Carlos Villela are <a href="www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorkers</a> following the lead of other company programmers, like <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/rinkrank/">Aslak</a> (who&#8217;s getting <a href="http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org/">DamageControl</a> on Rails) and <a href="http://wilkes.blogspot.com/2004/09/activerecord-and-yagni.html">John Wilkers</a>, in exploring Rails further.</p>
<p>And while the first hit was free, the addiction is now setting in. Carlos <a href="http://www.lixo.org/archives/2005/03/23/do-more-rails/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>&#8230;more often than not it&rsquo;s hard to stop coding; more than once I&rsquo;ve looked at the taskbar and gasped in disbelief &#8211; over the past month, I&rsquo;ve coded way past 2 AM after having worked the whole day, and even though I needed to wake up early the next morning, I was not tired at all. So, to put it in another words, careful &#8211; this thing is addictive.</blockquote>
<p>Obie takes a <a href="http://www.jroller.com/comments/obie/Weblog/ruby_rails_withdrawal_symptoms">slightly more bullish approach</a> and compares it with the woes of his day job in Java:</p>
<blockquote>At work, as of this monday I started work on a project that would have most Java open-source fanatics salivating. Custom web app running on Java 5, Tomcat 5.5, Hibernate 3, Webwork&#8230; Cutting edge stuff, right? Right?<br />
<br />
No way. Web development with Ruby leaves Java far, far behind.<br />
<br />
&#8230;<br />
<br />
Overall, the productivity loss is giving me withdrawal symptoms. I can&#8217;t wait to get back to my beloved Ruby this weekend.</blockquote>
<p>ThoughtWorks is the company that employs <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> as their chief scientist. I asked him for an opinion on it all and got: &#8220;At the moment what I&#8217;m waiting for is to see if some us can use Rails on an actual project.&#8221; Very much looking forward to hear his and the rest of the firm&#8217;s evaluation once ThoughtWorks is able to land its first Ruby on Rails contract.</p>
<p>Maybe the client Obie Fernandez is working with would be a good prospect. In the comments to Obie&#8217;s withdrawal posting, <a href="http://hhroark.blogspot.com/">Hank Roark</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>I just happen to be the customer of the project Obie is working on. And I&#8217;m pretty happy with the team&#8217;s progress. I&#8217;m afraid that my expectations have been lowered by years and years of experience in the Java realm. Obie may convince me to use Ruby Rails, yet.</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see so many ThoughtWorkers getting into Rails. I had the good fortunes to hang with their <span class="caps">JAOO</span> 2003 delegation shortly after I had picked up Ruby, while Rails was still a mere twinkle in my eye, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Rock on.</p>
