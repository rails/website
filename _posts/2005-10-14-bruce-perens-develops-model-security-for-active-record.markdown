<p>Bruce Perens is working on <a href="http://perens.com/FreeSoftware/ModelSecurity">model security</a> for Active Record sponsored by <a href="http://sourcelabs.com/">Sourcelabs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>I&#8217;ve developed ModelSecurity, a new Ruby on Rails facility that helps<br />
developers implement a security defense in depth by implementing<br />
access control within the data model.<br />
<br />
If you are like most developers, you think about security when you<br />
program controllers and views. But a bug in your controller or view can<br />
compromise the security of your application, unless your data model has<br />
also been secured.<br />
<br />
The economical, flexible, and extremely readable means of specifying<br />
access controls provided by ModelSecurity makes it easier for the<br />
developer to think about security, and makes security assumptions that<br />
might otherwise live in one developers head concrete and communicable<br />
to others.</blockquote>
<p>Please check it out and give Bruce a hand with testing.</p>
