<p>Dave Thomas is turning them into believers by the dozen at the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> symposiums. His one-two of <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=118">Ruby for Java Programmers</a> and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=119">Ruby on Rails</a> talks are delivering just the cocktail to get a whole lot of people interested.</p>
<p>One of those people is Rick Ross, the founder of <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/">Javalobby</a>. Under the heading of <i> Ruby on Rails is a powerhouse</i>, Rick wrote the following in the most recent newsletter from Javalobby:</p>
<blockquote>I didn&#8217;t get to spend much time at the No Fluff Just Stuff symposium here in Research Triangle Park this past weekend, but one noteworthy session I did get to attend was Dave Thomas&#8217; presentation about &#8220;Ruby on Rails.&#8221; I was amazed as I sat through the 90-minute presentation watching Dave knock out feature after feature of a real-life web application in record time and with more compact code than any I had previously seen.<br /><br />The Rails developers seem to have carefully considered the recurring pattern needs of web apps, and the framework provides full functionality for a typical database-backed <span class="caps">CRUD</span> (create, read, update, delete) application in a matter of minutes. Rails uses intelligent reflection to map database tables to Ruby objects, and the apps you generate with the Rails scripts form a very reasonable foundation for extending and customizing to meet your specific needs. Unit testing is built-in by default, as is a full web server for testing and debugging.<br /><br />The next time you need to get the job done very quickly you may want to try out Ruby on Rails for yourself. I don&#8217;t know enough yet to say how much it can scale, but Rails is quite clearly a major step forward for those who want web application development to be easier. Dave has a new book in beta, check it out here.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks a bunch, Rick. And keep it up, Dave.</p>
