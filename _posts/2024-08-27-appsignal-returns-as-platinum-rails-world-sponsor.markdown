In the lead up to Rails World, there are a few sponsors that we would like to highlight who are going above and beyond to make this an unforgettable Rails World for you. 

First up: <a href="https://www.appsignal.com/">AppSignal</a>.

AppSignal is once again stepping up as a Platinum sponsor for [Rails World 2024](/world/2024), taking place in Toronto on September 26th and 27th. This marks their second time as a Platinum sponsor at Rails World, and we couldn’t be more excited to have them back, or more grateful for their support.

**A quick aside:**
AppSignal has long been one of the biggest supporters of events and meetups in the Ruby space. In 2024 alone, they will sponsor an impressive 22 Ruby events across the globe, including shipping a staggering 500 kilos of their signature Dutch stroopwafels around the world as part of these sponsorships. 

**Now back to Rails World:**
If you attended Rails World last year, you'll know that AppSignal's booth was a highlight. While AppSignal as a company takes performance monitoring very seriously, as a brand and as a group of people, they also like to have a lot of fun. Anyone who stopped by their booth last year to enjoy a game of “sjoelen” knows that, and this year their presence at Rails World will be no different.

This year Rails World attendees can visit the AppSignal booth for stroopwafels, to grab a free t-shirt or a Developer Dilemmas card game, to chat with the team, or to play "sjoelen" to win _a year's supply_ of stroopwafels. (A year's worth. We're going to let that sink in for a moment.)

As part of their Platinum sponsorship, AppSignal will also be hosting Track 2, one of the main stages at Rails World 2024, where they will be running giveaways and contests in the breaks. To host their stage, they nominated Jim Remsik as the Track 2 emcee. If you haven’t already met him, Jim is a long-standing member of the Ruby community having organized <a href="https://www.madisonruby.com/">Madison+ Ruby</a> for several years, including its 2011–2018 run and its recent revival this year. We’re confident you’ll be in great hands on Track 2.

>I first met Jim over twelve years ago, and since then he’s been a continuous driving force in furthering the Ruby and Rails communities, as well as an empathetic executive. We share the same values and are thrilled that he is excited to host AppSignal’s Track 2.

Once again, we’re incredibly grateful for AppSignal’s continued support and can’t wait to see what they have in store for us this year. Make sure to visit their booth, and check out the sessions and games on Track 2.

See you in Toronto!
