<p>Master: &#8220;Hmmm. The argument on programmer productivity seems to be lost..&#8221;<br />
Apprentice: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/audio/gameover.wav">&#8220;It&#8217;s game over, man. Just game over! What the fuck are we gonna do now?!&#8221;</a><br />
Master: &#8220;You are mistaken, young one. There is always the ace: claim it can&#8217;t scale!&#8221;</p>
<p>Matt Raible caught the glimpse of a good headline and ran with it: <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/comments/rd/sunsets/rails_is_8_times_slower">Rails is 8 times slower than Spring+Hibernate</a>. The honorable source of this &#8220;fact&#8221; comes from &#8220;rix&#8221; &#8212; a <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/000735.html">commenter on one of Dion&#8217;s post</a> (ironically enough railing on this kind of silliness). He has done &#8220;extensive performance testing&#8221;, but of course doesn&#8217;t care to reveal his method, the apps compared, or the hardware setup used.</p>
<p>With this he concludes that Rails isn&#8217;t deserving of its attention and that he would rather develop with &#8220;&#8230;deployment descriptors! And verbose crap. And repetition.&#8221; Hehe. I don&#8217;t know where to start. Or even if I should. Perhaps other than to say that whenever Microsoft attempts to pull meaningless <span class="caps">FUD</span> like this, we call them on it.</p>
<p><i>Do note that I don&#8217;t doubt Java to be faster, I&#8217;m objecting to the silliness of publicizing and promoting figures with no context and to draw conclusions from these figures</i></p>
