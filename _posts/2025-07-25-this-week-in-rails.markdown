Hi, it's [Vipul](https://www.saeloun.com/team/vipul/). Let's explore this week's changes in the Rails codebase.

[Avoid dynamic encrypting in generated fixtures](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55387)  
Fixtures for passwords now generate a static hash. Previously, fixtures with password digest attributes regenerated the hash on each test run.

[Don't add bundler platforms for JRuby](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55383)  
Fixes Rails Apps on JRuby by not adding extra platforms that cause problems when installing gems.

[Make `ActiveSupport::Gzip.compress` deterministic](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55382)  
`ActiveSupport::Gzip.compress` now produces consistent output by always setting the gzip timestamp to zero, which eliminates flaky tests while comparing compressed data.

[Fix HashWithIndifferentAccess#transform_keys! to avoid collisions](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55376)  
Fixes a bug where changing keys in a hash could accidentally lose some keys if they clashed.

[Emit a warning when `pg` gem < 1.6.0 is used with PostgreSQL 18+](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55368)  
Adds a warning if a Rails project uses PostgreSQL 18+ with an outdated pg gem(< 1.6.0) to prevent compatibility issues of `PG::Connection#cancel`.

[Fix Action Cable compatibility with redis-rb 5.4.1](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55359)  
Makes Action Cable compatible with redis-rb 5.4.1, as an incompatibility bug in `redis-rb` is now resolved.

[Remove unnecessary calls to the GCP metadata server](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55353)  
Cuts out redundant calls to GCP's metadata server within auth logic, reducing potential latency and server load.

[Add load-hooks for Active Model autoloaded constants referenced in initializers](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55347)  
This change added load hooks for `active_model_error` and `active_model_secure_password`, making it easier for initializers to reference Active Model constants that should be autoloaded.

[`has_secure_password`: fix password validation.](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55232)  
Ensures password confirmation is validated even if the original password contains only whitespace, making `has_secure_password` behavior more consistent.

[Add render json to health](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55092)  
Enables Rails health controller to respond in JSON, improving support for API-only applications.

[Add ActiveRecord::Tasks::AbstractTasks for subclassing per adapter behavior](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/54879)  
Introduces a base class that allows database adapters to customize task behavior, thereby improving adapter-specific handling.

[Avoid purging the test database when loading a schema](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/54853)  
Prevents purging of the test database while loading a database schema, improving test suite reliability.

[gitignore all key files in config/credentials](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/54774)  
Configures `.gitignore` to exclude all files in `config/credentials`, protecting key files from accidental commits.

[Make `nonce: false` remove the nonce attribute for `javascript_tag`, `javascript_include_tag` and `stylesheet_link_tag`](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/54724)      
Setting `nonce: false` now removes the `nonce` attribute for `javascript_tag`, `javascript_include_tag`, and `stylesheet_link_tag`.

[Allow custom domain extractor class on ActionDispatch::Http::URL](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50763)  
Allows the use of a custom class for domain and subdomain extraction. If no custom extractor is set, a new default extractor, `ActionDispatch::Http::URL::DomainExtractor`, processes domains.

[Read `ActionText::Attachment.tag_name` in Action Text Fixtures](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50472)  
Updates Action Text fixture to use the right tag name for Action Text attachments if `config.action_text.attachment_tag_name` is set.

[Action View: Reduce public API of `tag` helper](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49369)  
Cleans up the public API surface of the tag helper for maintainability and clarity.
