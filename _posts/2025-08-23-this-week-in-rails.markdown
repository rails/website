Hi, it's [Greg](https://greg.molnar.io). Let's explore this week's changes in the Rails codebase.

[Rails Plugin documentation update](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55522)
As part of improving the documentation of the framework, The Rails Plugins Guide
has been updated.

[Fix consistency of generated _structure.sql_ for latest PostgreSQL versions which include _\restrict_](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55510)  
This pull request fixes the removal of _pg_dump_'s versioning comments by also removing the new `\restrict` lines. By removing all these lines, the generated _structure.sql_ can again be consistent between runs of `rails db:schema:dump` on the latest versions of PostgreSQL.

[Allow _current_page?_ to match against specific HTTP method(s) with a _method:_ option](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55286)  
Before this chage, the `current_page?` helper only matched on GET and HEAD
requests, but with the new optional `method` option, it will match against
explicit HTTP methods.

[Filter sensitive attributes in logs](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55251)  
Attributes filtered by `filter_attributes` will now also be filtered by
`filter_parameters` to assure that sensitive information is not leaked to the
logs.
