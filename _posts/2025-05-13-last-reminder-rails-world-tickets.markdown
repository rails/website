For those following the Rails blog via RSS, a last reminder that General Admission tickets (€499) will be available today, **Tuesday May 13th** at 5pm CEST.

Head to [the Rails World website](/world/2025) at 5pm to secure your tickets. 

This year we also set aside a limited number of Corporate Support tickets (€899), so if you prefer not to join the queue, those tickets are already available and serve to further support Rails World. Book Corporate Support tickets <a href="https://rails-foundation.neetoform.com/6c170cd8bdedc4b16ec0">here</a>.

Good luck and see you in September!
