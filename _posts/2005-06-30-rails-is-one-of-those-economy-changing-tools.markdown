<p>Pelle from Stake Ventures augments Joe Kraus&#8217; <a href="http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/2005/06/its_a_great_tim.html">It&rsquo;s a great time to be an entrepreneur</a> with the notion that on top of cheaper hardware and free infrastructure, <a href="http://stakeventures.com/articles/2005/06/30/it-s-a-great-time-to-be-an-entrepreneur">we also have better frameworks today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>It is a lot easier and quicker now to bring a new service from concept to launch. One of the biggest things helping this is the emergence of new practical web frameworks like Ruby on Rails . This allows single person or tiny teams to incredible things in very short time. <br />
<br />
There are other similar frameworks where you could do similar things quickly, but really Rails is one of those economy changing tools that is and will cause a lot of turmoil in the world of web applications.</blockquote>
<p>Productivity improvements are a big part of the push from the bottom. Skipping the need for scaling up in people makes it much easier to get off the ground. $100K is quite a lush sum if all you need is three people for a couple of months.</p>
