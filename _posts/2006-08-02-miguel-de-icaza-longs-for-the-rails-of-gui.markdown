<p>Open source hacker extraordinaire Miguel de Icaza muses about <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Aug-02.html">the state of <span class="caps">GUI</span> APIs in light of Avalon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><i>I just had a realization today.<br />
<br />
Microsoft&#8217;s Avalon is the J2EE of <span class="caps">GUI</span> APIs.<br />
<br />
Its God&#8217;s way of punishing us for replacing the ten commandments with the Design Pattern fad.<br />
<br />
We will have to wait a couple of years for the &#8220;Rails&#8221; of <span class="caps">GUI</span> toolkits to come into existance. In the meantime programmers will pay for their sins.<br />
<br />
Avalon marks the end of the American Dream.</i></blockquote>
<p>Now that&#8217;s not a happy programmer speaking.</p>
