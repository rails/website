<p>Tim Case was playing the .<span class="caps">NET</span> game when one destined Saturday afternoon <a href="http://blog.curthibbs.us/articles/read/40#comment-61">sent him a wakeup call</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Last November one Saturday afternoon I was pissed off and frustrated trying to get NHibernate to work with my middle-tier C# layer, and in the midst of my difficulties I did what all great people do when faced with tough problems and hardship&#8230; I procrastinated by surfing the net. From Prag Dave&rsquo;s site I made it the the rails site and in attempt to further prove that techology lies I ran the 10 minute intro video&#8230;<br />
<br />
10 minutes later, I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I had just saw, so I started doing the Rails academy tutorials&#8230;<br />
<br />
One hour later, my jaw was on the ground as I stared at my todo application running from MySQL so I started investigating rails further&#8230;<br />
<br />
Two hours later my .<span class="caps">NET</span> career was over. It literally happened that afternoon. I no longer had any interest in NHibernate or even seeing Visual Studio ever again.</blockquote>
<p>Tim Case also wrote an interesting article called &#8220;Where the Rails came from&#8230;&#8221; that traces the influences of Kent Beck (<span class="caps">TDD</span>), Eric Evans (<span class="caps">DDD</span>), Martin Fowler (PoEAA), Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt (Pragmatic Programmer), and a lot more. We&#8217;ll see if we can get that online shortly.</p>
