**On to the recap**

Just over **1,000 Rails devs** from **57 countries** gathered in Toronto for two days of technical talks, workshops, networking, evening parties, the **Rails 8 beta release**…and one glorious neon sign.

We packed a lot into these two days, so here’s a quick run down of the highlights:
- Rails Core **launched Rails 8 beta** live from the audience during **DHH’s keynote**.
- We followed 24 technical talks (and a workshop) by **28 great speakers** on two tracks hosted by **GitHub** and **AppSignal**.
- Shopify CEO **Tobi Lütke** invited **DHH** and **Matz** to a fireside chat on Ruby, Rails, and the joy of working with both.
- DHH surprised **Matz** with his first-ever award - the **Rails Lifetime Award**.
- Xavier Noria awarded **Akira Matsuda** with the **2024 Rails Luminary Award**.
- **Clio** and the **Toronto Ruby meetup** hosted an awesome Day 1 party.
- **Eileen Uchitelle** got heads nodding with a Day 2 keynote on the potential pros and cons of a modular monolith.
- Shopify hosted the first **Lightning Track**, with 14 attendees giving quick talks on topics from gaming to Hotwire Native.
- Two attendees won brand new Framework laptops, plus others won a ton of amazing **raffle prizes** from sponsors.
- **Aaron Patterson** delivered a memorable closing keynote on speeding up the Rails router (with “30 minutes of bullshit” - his words).
- **Shopify’s epic closing party** spanned three floors of fun—food, drinks, games, music, and skyline views.

And did we mention the neon sign? We’ll stop talking about the sign. …soon.

Based on the feedback survey, here is what you thought worked well:
- _The people/hallway track, the energy, new Rails feature announcements, the after parties, the venue, the focus on technical talks instead of "soft" talks._
- _All-inclusive feeling. Shuttles, great food, pre-registration, the match-making service._
- _Amazing venue, loved the chill out areas, food, music, etc._
- _The atmosphere built was really good (loved track 2's open air), and the after parties were pretty great as well._
- _Great coffee. Food trucks. Emcees from the community. Shopify's after-party. Good balance of talks and breaks in a full-day schedule._

Was there anything that didn’t work?  The most reported answer by far was: chairs. You _really_ hated those chairs. 

Fun backstory: Those were not the chairs we ordered. The day before the event the furniture company told us they didn’t have enough of the one we ordered, so they sent different chairs as a replacement. Sometimes that’s the way things play out with events.

You also weren’t crazy about the wasps out in the Pavilion, which, you know….fair. 
(Note to self: no wasps next time.)

Humor aside, you also shared a lot of feedback about things we _can_ control (schedule, content, parties, etc) that we will take into consideration for next year, so thank you for all of your suggestions!
