The Rails Foundation is delighted to announce that <a href="https://www.appsignal.com">AppSignal</a>, the renowned application monitoring company built on Rails and based in the Netherlands, is the Platinum sponsor at [Rails World](/world) this year.

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-appsignal.svg" style="width: 50%"></p>

AppSignal has been an integral part of the Rails community for years, and earlier this year stepped up their ongoing commitment to the Rails community by [becoming a Contributing member](/2023/4/17/appsignal-is-newest-contributing-member-of-rails-foundation) of the Rails Foundation.

Now they are taking their commitment one step further by becoming the premiere Platinum sponsor at the first Rails World taking place this October in Amsterdam. This Platinum sponsorship highlights AppSignalâ€™s belief in the Rails framework's potential and also signifies their determination to foster growth and development within the Rails community. 

With their history of infusing Rails events with a touch of fun and a ton of stroopwafels, AppSignal is an invaluable partner in helping make this first edition of Rails World an unforgettable experience for all who attend.

Thank you, AppSignal, for your continued support and dedication to the Rails ecosystem.
