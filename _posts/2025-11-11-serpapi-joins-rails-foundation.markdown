Today we welcome a new Contributing member of the Rails Foundation: <a href="https://serpapi.com/">SerpApi</a>.

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-serpapi.png" style="width: 50%"></p>

Founded in 2017, SerpApi enables developers and companies to scrape search engine results from platforms like Google, Amazon, and others, returning structured data in a clean and easy-to-use JSON format. 

>We at SerpApi have used Rails since our earliest days. I’m grateful for how easy it is to maintain and improve our product with it. I’m also inspired by how Rails helped make the MVC pattern a global standard in web development.<br>

SerpApi’s API, frontend, and background jobs all run on Ruby on Rails. Their app is a majestic monolith, deployed on a cluster of AWS EC2 instances from their automation scripts from CI.

SerpApi relies on a wide range of gems including **Mongoid**, **Sidekiq**, **Redis**, **Puma**, **Stripe-Rails**, **Airbrake**, **AWS SDK**, **HTTP.rb**, **Nokogiri**, **Nokolexbor**, and **Geokdtree**. For frontend development, the team uses **ERB**, **jQuery-Rails**, and **React-Rails**.

SerpApi’s contributions to the Ruby ecosystem extend well beyond their own products. They maintain and support several open-source gems, including:
- <a href="https://github.com/serpapi/nokolexbor">nokolexbor</a> – a high-performance HTML5 parser for Ruby
- <a href="https://github.com/serpapi/ethon-impersonate">ethon-impersonate</a> – a fork of Ethon that wraps libcurl-impersonate.
- <a href="https://github.com/serpapi/turbo_tests">turbo_tests</a> – a faster, incremental test runner for large Rails codebases
- <a href="https://github.com/serpapi/serpapi-ruby">serpapi-ruby</a> – the official Ruby wrapper for SerpApi’s endpoints
- <a href="https://github.com/serpapi/clauneck">clauneck</a> – a tool for finding contact information via Google Search Results
- <a href="https://github.com/serpapi/uule_converter">uule_converter</a> – a Ruby library for encoding and decoding Google search UULE parameters
- <a href="https://github.com/serpapi/google-local-results-ai-parser">google-local-results-ai-parser</a> – a gem that extracts structured data from Google Local Search Results using AI-based parsing models

SerpApi is also active in the wider developer community, organizing and sponsoring events such as Riverhacks x NASA Space Apps Challenge, Multimodal Search AI Hackathon, and upcoming sponsorships at IDSW.dev and PyCon Indonesia.

The Rails Foundation looks forward to working with SerpApi on our mission to support the Rails community.
