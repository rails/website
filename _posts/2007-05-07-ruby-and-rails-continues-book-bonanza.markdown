<p>O&#8217;Reilly has <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/05/state_of_the_co_6.html">analyzed the book sales once again</a>. Here are the juicy bits about Ruby and Rails books:</p>
<blockquote>In the Web design and development area, it&#8217;s worth noting that Ruby on Rails has continued its blazing growth, but Ajax books have not. The decline of both <span class="caps">PHP</span> and <span class="caps">ASP</span> are striking&#8230;<br />
<br />
&#8230;Rails in the bottom middle was a small speck in last year&#8217;s first quarter post. Now the size of the box fits the size of its name at least. And its market share is almost equal to <span class="caps">SQL</span> and has surpassed <span class="caps">VBA</span>, Perl and Python. Python is also experiencing good growth, just not at the blazing velocity of Ruby. I would expect by next year, we will see Ruby have an even larger share/square.</blockquote>
