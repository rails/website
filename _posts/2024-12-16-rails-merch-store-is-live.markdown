It’s been a long time coming, many of you have asked for it, and now the wait is over. Today the official Rails merch store launches in the United States and Canada! 

[Explore the first collection here.](https://merch.rubyonrails.org/)

The first collection is **simple** and **classic**: high-quality and comfortable t-shirts and hoodies, a travel mug, a cap, and a Rails baby onesie for your tiny future programmer. But this is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more designs and items coming soon.

By wearing Rails merch, you’re not just showing support for Rails as a framework; you’re also celebrating being part of an open-source community that has continued to thrive for more than two decades.

We can’t wait to see you out in the wild wearing your Rails pride! (Bonus points for tagging Rails in your shots on social media.)

Note: Items are priced as close to production cost as possible, meaning there's no markup. Any small profit from the store will go directly back into the Rails Foundation’s mission of improving the documentation, education, marketing, and events in the Rails community to the benefit of all new and existing Rails developers.

**Fun facts:**

- The Rails merch store is built on Shopify, because Shopify is built on Rails.  
- The models are also from the Rails community - two are volunteers from Le Wagon, the largest Rails bootcamp in Europe, and the baby is the daughter of a Rails dev Max Chernyak.

**Why just the US and Canada?**

We know many Rails developers outside the US and Canada are eager for Rails merch. Unfortunately, launching an online retail store involves challenges like production, warehousing, fulfillment, taxes, and shipping, and right now, we haven’t found an international solution that’s both cost-effective and maintains the high quality and low prices we aim for. But we’re working on it and hope to expand to more regions in the future. Thank you for your patience!
