<p>In stark <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/archives/2005/09/08/oracle-java-panda-says-lamp-doesn-t-scale">contrast to Panda</a>, Dave Thomas presents <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/Ruby/IsRailsReadyForPrimeTime.html">the pragmatic approach</a> to deciding between J2EE and Ruby on Rails.</p>
<blockquote>Using the full might of a J2EE stack to write a small stand-alone application is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But I keep hearing the sound of nuts being pulverized as developers seem to think that using anything other than J2EE is somehow unprofessional.<br />
<br />
At the same time, there are situations that call for the shock and awe that is J2EE.</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely a continuum. Rails doesn&#8217;t replace, well, <i>anything</i>. Things are never replaced, but increase and decrease in relevance. Rails has decreased the relevance of a lot of environments, including J2EE, for a growing niche of application types. But it hasn&#8217;t replaced them and never will.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, Dave moves to answer &#8220;when is Rails appropriate?&#8221; and &#8220;how can I introduce it where I work?&#8221;. Great advice for picking an entry and moving your company through the transition to Rails.</p>
