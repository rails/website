The mission of the Rails Foundation is to help the Rails ecosystem prosper, and one way we can do that is by connecting programmers and companies working with Rails. So today we're introducing the <a href="https://jobs.rubyonrails.org">official Rails Job Board</a>, a platform for Rails developers to find their next role (and companies to find their next Rails developer). 

Whether you're a senior Rails developer seeking new challenges, a contractor looking for part-time work, a company eager to add a junior developer to your team, the Rails Job Board is the best place to find your next match.

**Job seekers**, browse remote and hybrid developer roles in companies around the world. Be sure to subscribe to the newsletter or the <a href="https://jobs.rubyonrails.org/jobs.rss">RSS feed</a> to be the first to hear about new roles, straight to your inbox.

**Employers**, take advantage of our affordable ad placements ranging from $199 to $299, with featured ads enjoying additional exposure on the official Rails LinkedIn channel. With over 110k unique visitors each month, the official Rails website stands as the premier destination for reaching skilled Rails developers actively seeking their next role.

**Launch Special** 
To celebrate the launch of the job board, we are offering a Basic ad for just $99. Available on any ad placed before December 31st, 2023.

All proceeds from the Job Board will directly contribute to the Rails Foundation's mission. By posting jobs on our platform, you play a vital role in fostering the growth and sustainability of the Rails ecosystem.

Thank you to everyone who sent us this suggestion since the Rails Foundation was launched, and good luck finding your next career match!


**Note**: The Rails Job Board was built on <a href="https://www.jobkit.io/">JobKit.io</a>, a job board platform built on - you guessed it - Rails. Many thanks to Emil Nikov for his help getting it ready for launch.
