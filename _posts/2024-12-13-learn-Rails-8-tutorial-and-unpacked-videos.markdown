Rails 8 is a major milestone, and for the first time in Rails' history, thanks to the support of the members of the [Rails Foundation](/foundation), we are able to support this major release with new and updated tutorials, videos, and guides to help developers learn Rails' new default features as quickly as possible.

If you want to learn more, here’s where you should start.

**The (new) Getting Started Tutorial**

The revamped Getting Started Guide walks you through building an e-commerce site while introducing Rails fundamentals and the latest Rails 8 defaults. Learn to use:

- the built-in **Authentication Generator** to create an admin system for managing products.
- Action Mailer, Active Job, and **Solid Queue** to run background jobs that send email notifications to subscribers when products are back in stock. 
- **Solid Cache** to cache product information and improve performance. 
- **Kamal 2.0** to deploy your app to production.

This tutorial is beginner-friendly yet comprehensive, designed to make Rails accessible to everyone and welcome beginners to Rails for years to come. It’s also expandable, paving the way for future tutorials adding more features to the app.

**Note**: The <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html">Installation Guide</a> is now separate from the Getting Started Guide, making it easier to find.

Special thanks to **Chris Oliver** of <a href="https://gorails.com/">GoRails</a> for writing this tutorial, with help from Rafael França, Xavier Noria, Jeremy Daer, Matthew Draper, Collin Jilbert, Kent Crutchfield, Harriet Oughton, Julian Duss, Santiago Rodriguez, Gianlo Occhipinti, Kim Perino, and all the reviewers on GitHub.

**Rails 8 Unpacked with Typecraft**

**Rails 8 Unpacked with Typecraft** is a 9-part video series exploring Rails 8’s default features through the lens of adding features to a task management demo app. 

You’ll learn:
- Authentication with the new **Authentication Generator**.
- Asset management using **Propshaft**.
- The **Solid Trifecta** for caching, messaging, and job queueing.
- Deployment with **Kamal 2.0**.

You can build your own app or follow along with the demo app by checking out the branches of the GitHub repo found under each episode.

- **Propshaft** as the default in the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Asset Pipeline Guide</a> 
- **Solid Cache** in the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html">Caching Guide</a>
- **Solid Queue** in the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html">Active Job Basics Guide</a>

More updates are on the way! Thanks to the docs team - **Ridhwana Khan**, **Bhumi Shah**, **Harriet Oughton**, **Petrik de Heus** - and everyone in the community who reviewed their PRs.
