The Rails Foundation is proud to welcome <a href="https://www.planetargon.com/">Planet Argon</a> as our newest Contributing member.

Planet Argon have been active participants in the Ruby on Rails ecosystem since the beginning of 2005. And when we say active, we are not exaggerating.

In addition to their day-to-day mission helping organizations with existing Ruby on Rails apps make them better and more maintainable, their <a href="https://rails-hosting.com/">biennial Ruby on Rails developer community survey</a> has provided valuable insights into the state of the Rails community since 2009. They also created <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My Zsh</a>, one of the most popular open-source frameworks for managing your terminal experience, which also comes with a <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/rails">Rails plugin</a>.

The Planet Argon team were speakers at the very first Rails community conferences, and over the years have organized fun community building events like the <a href="https://robbyonrails.com/articles/tag/argonexpress.html">Argon Express</a> (a group train trip from Portland to Chicago) and the <a href="https://blog.planetargon.com/blog/entries/argon-trail">Argon Trail</a> (a hike for 50 Rails developers).

This delightful, innovative approach to community-building is what makes the Planet Argon's contributions to Rails community so unique, and for that reason and many more, the Rails Foundation is thrilled to have Planet Argon join the foundation.

>Ruby on Rails has long been regarded as an excellent tool for startups and makers. Our delightful clients benefit from the contributions of the Ruby on Rails community as it enables small teams to achieve big goals.
<br><br>After learning about the Rails Foundation's goals and upcoming plans, we asked how we could join the mission. This investment is less an attempt to plant new seeds but rather to help improve the maintainability of an already flourishing garden.
<br><br>We believe in a blossoming future for Ruby on Rails. All Aboard!

We look forward to collaborating with Planet Argon collaborating on improving and maintaining the future of the Rails community for the benefit of current Rails developers as well as future generations.
