<p>Omninerd published an introduction to <a href="http://home.leetsoft.com/am">ActiveMerchant</a>.<br />
AM is a credit card processing library extracted from <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a> in much the same way Rails was originally extracted from Basecamp.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omninerd.com/2007/01/23/articles/66">Processing Credit Cards with Ruby on Rails</a></p>
<p>The article talks about Authorize.net as a payment provider but ActiveMerchant supports a variety of gateways such as  Authorize.net, Moneris, TrustCommerce, LinkPoint, Psigate, Paypal Payments Pro, Paypal Payments Standard, eWay, <span class="caps">USA</span> ePay, NoChex and Chronopay. All of the supported gateways are in production use in Shopify.</p>
