**Mark your calendars**: [Rails World](/world) 2025 will take place **September 4 and 5, 2025**, again in **Amsterdam**. The same venue, the same city, and good news - this time we will release more tickets.

We don’t have a specific timeline yet, but you can expect the CFP to open in early spring 2025, and tickets to be released shortly thereafter.

For any companies looking to sponsor, we will have the prospectus ready soon, so please email <a href="mailto:sponsors@rubyonrails.org">sponsors@rubyonrails.org</a> to receive a copy.

**But…why Amsterdam again?**

You might be wondering why we’ve chosen to return to Amsterdam and the same venue. 

The answer is simple: by working with a familiar space and trusted vendors, we can build on the foundation we created last year rather than starting from scratch with new logistics in a new city. This will allow us to focus energy into the program and content, and elevating the overall experience.

But don’t worry - this decision doesn’t mean Amsterdam is our permanent home. The Rails Foundation board is unanimous in wanting Rails World to change cities every year. This year, however, it simply made logistical (and financial!) sense to stick with what we know works.

So if you missed Rails World 2023, this will likely be your last chance to join us in Amsterdam - at least for the foreseeable future! 

Stay tuned for more updates early next year, including the CFP details and ticket release dates. Questions can be sent to <a href="mailto:world@rubyonrails.org">world@rubyonrails.org</a>.
