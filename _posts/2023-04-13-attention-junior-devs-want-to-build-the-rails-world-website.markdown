Rails World needs a website! Do you want to be on the small team that helps build it?

There is a lot of talk about supporting junior developers with more opportunities, and at the Rails Foundation, we couldn't agree more. It's hard for junior devs to get a foot in the door in today's uncertain job market without solid experience.

Therefore, we are excited to announce a paid opportunity for a junior developer to work on creating the Rails World website. The Rails Foundation will act as your client, and you will be paired with a mentor for support. Both developer and mentor must be legally set up as a freelancer so that work can begin immediately.

__Project: Rails World website team__

The Rails World website will consist of several phases, beginning with a landing page, then expanding to a full 5-page website (homepage, tickets, FAQ, speakers, agenda). This will be an ongoing project starting immediately until October with the majority of the work due in June (please see brief for more details of timing). 

For this team we are looking for:
- 1 freelance junior developer
- 1 freelance experienced mentor

Both positions will be paid.

It is our hope that at the end of this project, the junior developer will have a valuable addition to their developer portfolio, as well as payment for their work, and we will have a fantastic new website.

This is a new project for the Rails Foundation and will be approached as an experiment. As such, feedback on this project is welcome, even if you are not applying yourself. Feel free to send that feedback using <a href="https://app.todohelpers.com/forms/4758b5b0-d6f9-4f41-8041-992cc9b748fb">this suggestion form</a>.
