The second edition of [Rails World](/world/2024) is fast approaching, so we are excited to share with you the list of speakers joining us in Toronto this year.

These speakers will deep dive into new tools such as Solid Queue and Kamal Proxy, and share insights on enhancing and understanding Rails, deploying with Kamal, optimizing database performance, automating Rails upgrades, improving accessibility and security, and much more.
