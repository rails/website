Last year, we introduced case studies highlighting how companies use and build with Rails. Next up, we’re highlighting the story of <a href="https://cookpad.com/">Cookpad</a>, the world’s largest recipe-sharing platform, and how Rails has powered their growth from a small startup in Japan to a global platform serving more than 100 million home cooks every month.

In this case study, you’ll read how and why Cookpad migrated from ColdFusion to Rails in 2007, and how Rails has supported their growth every day since, from their expansion to many more countries, all the way to their public offering on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

_A huge thank-you to the Cookpad engineering team for generously sharing their story, and a big shout-out to everyone involved in helping bring this case study to life, including Robby Russell from Planet Argon._

**Why we’re sharing these stories**

A big part of the Rails Foundation’s mission is to help people discover what you already know - that Rails is one of the best frameworks to build fast, flexible, and scalable applications. There’s no better proof than the real stories of companies like Cookpad. These case studies show how Rails lets teams of all sizes to move quickly and achieve meaningful results, so they can put their energy into what counts: growing the business, serving their users, and implementing new features.

Cookpad and Doximity (previously released) are just two stories - find them both on the [Docs landing page](/docs), and stay tuned for more coming soon.
