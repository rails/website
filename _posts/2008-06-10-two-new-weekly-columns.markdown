<p>I&#8217;d like to introduce two new contributors to the Rails blog.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2008/6/10/ChuYeow_1.jpg" align="right" border="1" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;" /><br />
First up is <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/">Chu Yeow</a>.  Chu has been putting together weekly <strong>Living on the Edge</strong> blog posts where he covers what&#8217;s been going on in Edge Rails.  It seemed to me like it should be on the official blog, so expect to see his weekly updates showing up here shortly.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2008/6/10/cangiano_1.jpg" align="right" border="1" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;" /><br />
Secondly is <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/">Antonio Cangiano</a>.  Antonio started doing blog posts entitled <strong>This Week in Ruby</strong> a few months back which, as you might expect, cover all the significant events of the prior week.  Antonio has agreed to move his weekly &#8220;Rails&#8221; stories over here, so we can all benefit from getting a summary of what&#8217;s going on in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Then I should probably say a word about me, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m on the core team or work at 37 Signals so why am I here?  I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.RailsEnvy.com">Gregg Pollack</a>, one of the Rails Envy guys, and I&#8217;m here to help cover stories and help shape up the RubyOnRails.org website so the real core team can focus on coding.</p>
<p>So if you have any Rails stories that belong on here please email me (Gregg at RailsEnvy).  Worst case scenario I&#8217;ll cover it on the next <a href="http://www.RailsEnvy.com/podcast">Rails Envy Podcast</a>.</p>
