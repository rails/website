Starting at [Rails World](/world) in October, the Rails Foundation will establish a new tradition of celebrating __Rails Luminaries__- people who've contributed to the Rails ecosystem and community with exceptional code, documentation, enthusiasm, or assistance, thereby helping others do more, learn more, or be inspired. 

Now, we'd like your help. You have a chance to shine a light on the individuals who have inspired you, and who define what it means to be a part of the Rails community.

Do you know someone who has consistently gone above and beyond to help others, who has shaped discussions, answered countless questions, triaged bugs, added particularly helpful features, or introduced us all to innovative new ideas? 

Nominate these exceptional individuals who you believe deserve to be recognized using the form below.

The nominations will be reviewed by Rails Core for the first batch, and Rails Core plus all past Rails Luminaries going forward.

The final pick of Rails Luminaries will be honored in a special ceremony at Rails World, and will receive a trophy for their service, as well as a monetary award of $1,000.

Submit your 2023 Rails Luminary nomination <a href="https://app.todohelpers.com/forms/f217db04-3b7d-4d20-9df7-75a5ec3acc3c">here</a>. 

Shine bright!
