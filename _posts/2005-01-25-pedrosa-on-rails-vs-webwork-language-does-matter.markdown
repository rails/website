<p>Joao Pedrosa has been using both Rails and WebWork and iterates <a href="http://sinsalabintrix.blogspot.com/2005/01/motion-on-rails.html">five key points</a> on why &#8220;&#8230;WW is clearly inferior to Rails in every aspect&#8221; before arriving at the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>Although I think RoR is superior to all Java web framework I used so far, I really respect the WW guys for building this framework which is one of the coolest in Javaland (unfortunately still ruled by crapware like Struts) but there is absolutely NO <span class="caps">WAY</span> any Java framework can compete with RoR&#8230; just try to build some real life app with it to figure out yourself how much precious time you&#8217;ve been wasting until now.<br/><br/>Time to shutdown <span class="caps">IDEA</span> and launch <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a>, 2005 will definetly be the year of Ruby on Rails! :)</blockquote>
