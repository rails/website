When [Rails 7.0](/2021/12/15/Rails-7-fulfilling-a-vision) landed in December 2021, it came with a fresh new homepage and a new boot screen. The design of the guides, however, has remained largely untouched since 2009 - a point which hasn’t gone unnoticed (we heard your feedback).

With all of the work right now going into removing complexity from the Rails framework and making the [documentation](/2024/2/6/documentation-update-work-has-begun) consistent, clear, and up-to-date, it was time to tackle the design of the guides and make them equally modern, simple, and fresh.

We worked with UX designer <a href="https://meticulous.com/">John Athayde</a> to take the look and feel of the homepage and transfer that over to the Rails Guide to make it clean, sleek, and up-to-date.

The layout will remain the same, but from today you will see the following changes reflected in the <a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/">Edge Guides</a>:

- Cleaner, less busy design.
- Fonts, color scheme, and logo more consistent with the home page.
- Updated iconography.
- Simplified navigation.
- Sticky ‘Chapter’ navbar when scrolling.

For now, this refresh is still a work in progress, so it is only reflected in the <a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/">Edge Guides</a> while we make the final adjustments. Once we are happy with it, we will update the guides for stable Rails 7 versions. This design will then render for all new guides from the next release onwards.
