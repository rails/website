Hey everyone, Happy Monday! 
[Vipul](https://www.saeloun.com/team/vipul) here with the latest updates for This Week in Rails (from last week ðŸ˜…). Let's dive in.

[Rails 7.2 has been released](https://rubyonrails.org/2024/8/10/Rails-7-2-0-has-been-released)  
Rails 7.2 has been released!

Head over to the [release post](https://rubyonrails.org/2024/8/10/Rails-7-2-0-has-been-released) for more details, 
but in short, it ships with better production defaults, Dev containers, new guides design, and much much more!


**New Guides Pull Requests for review**  
Two new Guides Pull Requests are now open for community review. If you are well versed in Rails Routing, Active Record Associations, please review and submit your feedback here:

- [Rails Routing PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52521)
- [Active Record Associations PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52523)

[Use Thruster by default for Rails 8](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51793)  
[Thruster](https://github.com/basecamp/thruster/) is an asset compression and caching proxy with X-Sendfile acceleration that speeds up simple production-ready deployments of Rails applications. 
It runs alongside the Puma and usually behind the Kamal 2 proxy, which offers HTTP/2 and SSL auto-certificates, 
to help your app run efficiently and safely on the open Internet.

This change configures the use of Thruster in the Dockerfile by default, starting with Rails 8.

[Speed up `ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Scope#[]` by merging frame hashes](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52525)  
Before this change, `ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Scope#[]` lookup was iterating an array, which means access time wasn't constant, and did not actually behave like a hash.

This Pull Request changes the scope implementation to make the lookup faster by just merging inherited values into the immediate hash. 

This helps avoid needless iterations for deeply nested routes leading it to be **~1.2x** faster.

[Remove redundant Puma configuration settings](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52541)  
This Pull Request removes the following redundant environment settings in `puma.rb`:

```ruby
# Specifies the `environment` that Puma will run in.
rails_env = ENV.fetch("RAILS_ENV", "development")
environment rails_env

case rails_env
when "production"
  preload_app!
when "development"
  # Specifies a very generous `worker_timeout` so that the worker
  # isn't killed by Puma when suspended by a debugger.
  worker_timeout 3600
end
```

These changes address recent Puma upgrades that-

- Puma now automatically sets its environment from RAILS_ENV.
- `preload_app!` is automatically set when in cluster mode.
- `worker_timeout` is a cluster mode feature, and we don't run that in dev.

Another Puma change is that `WEB_CONCURRENCY` is automatically used from ENV and is now parsed directly, so it can't be extended with "auto" in the Puma config.

[This related change](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/142e6ab2c1e3cb7df4b82e20e2a1cd676b755714) addresses this issue and removes the redundant dynamic setting for the value from `puma.rb`

[Improve default action mailer configuration](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52513)  
This Pull Request introduces a few improvements to the default Action Mailer configuration setup:

- Suggests a default SMTP server configuration in a comment in `production.rb`.
- Sets a default example.com host for mailer links in production too.
- Uses the same comment style in all the env settings for mailer host.

[Make automatic detection of processor count in default Puma config optional and non-default](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52533)  
Using `Concurrent.available_processor_count` helper by default in `puma.rb` template might result in incorrect configurations on some cloud hosts with shared CPUs or platforms that inaccurately report CPU counts.

This Pull Request, changes this default configuration to be optional and non-default.

[Let allow_browser allow bots](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52531)  
The `allow_browser` feature blocks requests with user agents that don't match a specific set of browser versions. This runs the risk of preventing sites from being crawled by some search engines.

This change fixes this behavior to bypass these version restrictions in the case of certain crawlers and bots.

[Allow disable_extension to be called with schema-qualified name for PostgreSQL](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52452)  
This change allows `disable_extension` to be called with schema-qualified name for PostgreSQL.

This adds parity with `enable_extension`, the `disable_extension` method can be called with a schema-qualified
name (e.g. `disable_extension "myschema.pgcrypto"`). Note that PostgreSQL's `DROP EXTENSION` does not
actually take a schema name (unlike `CREATE EXTENSION`), so the resulting SQL statement will only name
the extension, e.g. `DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS "pgcrypto"`.
