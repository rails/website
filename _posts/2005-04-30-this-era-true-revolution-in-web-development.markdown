<p>Phu Ly is a software developer working out of London that <a href="http://www.ifelse.co.uk/archives/2005/04/30/ruby-on-rails/">seems to quite fancy</a> the Rails:</p>
<blockquote>Ruby on Rails has to be the one of the real breakthroughs in Web Development and indeed, development itself&#8230;<br />
<br />
This is no hyperbole. Far more so than Ajax, this is this era&rsquo;s true revolution in web development. The majesty of the framework is sufficient for me to make a long term commitment to Ruby; In fact, calling RoR a Ruby framework understates things; it&rsquo;s probably the killer app for Ruby itself.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Phu.</p>
