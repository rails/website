Hi, it's [Vipul](https://www.saeloun.com/team/vipul/). Happy Friday ðŸŽƒ!   
Let's explore this week's changes in the Rails codebase.

**New Guides Pull Request for review**  
A new guides [Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55188) is up, which updates the Active Record Encryption Guide. If you are well versed in these areas, please review and submit your feedback on the PR!

We also have 2 other Guides PRs open where you can help out! 
- Update [Threading and Code Execution Guide](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55179) 
- Move and merge [PostgreSQL Guide into the API](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55135) and other guides   

[Fix affected_rows for SQLite adapter](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55180)  
This update refines the SQLite adapter's `affected_rows` logic. It addresses two issues: `#changes` wasn't reset for non-mutating queries like SELECT, while `#total_changes` could overcount due to including cascading deletes. 
The new approach uses `#total_changes` to detect whether any rows were affected and `#changes` to return the most accurate count.

[Add ability to change the transaction isolation for all pools within a block](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55176)
This change introduces a new method, `ActiveRecord.with_transaction_isolation_level`, which allows temporarily changing the transaction isolation level for all database pools accessed within a block. This simplifies handling multiple databases or shards by avoiding the need to loop through each pool individually, improving performance and easing transaction management.

[Active Job Continuations improvements](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55174)  
This PR improves Active Jobâ€™s continuation system by adding runtime instrumentation for each step, introducing configurable job resumption options; 
preventing checkpoints inside database transactions; adjusting checkpoint timing to before each step; and ensures errors are raised if step order changes when resuming.
