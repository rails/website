The Rails Foundation is excited to announce [**Rails World**](/world), our first conference. It will take place on October 5 & 6 in the stunning city of Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Rails World is a two-day conference featuring technical talks, demos, workshops, networking, and keynotes. You'll hear from the creators and maintainers of Rails on the latest features and best practices in Rails development.  

With Rails World, our goal is to create a fun and affordable space for the Rails ecosystem to connect, learn, and build lasting professional relationships.  

A limited number of Early bird tickets for Rails World will start at just **€199**. After that, General Admission tickets will be **€299**.

With just 650 tickets available in total for the first Rails World, we expect them to sell out quickly. So make sure to book your ticket early if you intend to go!

This super accessible price is made possible by the financial support of our foundation Core members <a href="https://cookpad.com">Cookpad</a>, <a href="https://www.doximity.com">Doximity</a>, <a href="https://www.fleetio.com">Fleetio</a>, <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.intercom.com">Intercom</a>, <a href="https://www.procore.com">Procore</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>, and <a href="https://37signals.com">37signals</a>, as well as our Contributing members <a href="https://www.cedarcode.com">Cedarcode</a> and <a href="https://planetargon.com">Planet Argon</a>, and of course the support of Rails World sponsors who join us. Rails World is not meant to make a profit for the Rails Foundation; we are happy to organize this at a loss so that ticket prices stay affordable.

Whether you're a seasoned Rails developer or just starting out, join hundreds of other developers who share your passion for Rails at the first ever Rails World, and become part of the rich history and ongoing evolution of Ruby on Rails.

We can't wait to see you there!

We are working hard to get everything up and running for you, so soon we will launch:
* [A full website](/world) with venue and hotel information
* Early bird tickets
* A speaker CFP
* A sponsorship prospectus (email world@rubyonrails.org if you would like to receive the prospectus when it is ready)

Stay tuned. We promise to keep you in the loop as planning progresses!
