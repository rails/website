<blockquote>john: i was going to the airport and the driver (the car service we use) asks if i know martin fowler.<br />
<br />
john: i said yes, why do you ask&#8230;<br />
<br />
john: he shows me his RoR Agile book by Dave Thomas<br />
<br />

<br />
john: Smal world&#8230;He used to be a developer b4 he moved from london here&#8230;hard time getting a job&#8230;</blockquote>
