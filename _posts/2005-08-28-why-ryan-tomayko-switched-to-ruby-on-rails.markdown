<p>Ryan Tomayko is a long-term Python guy in search of a web-development platform for his small tech company. His <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/08/28/choosing-the-platform/">evaluation</a> first went along the lines of <a href="http://www.journalhome.com/codecraft/9003/">safety vs freedom languages</a> where he rejected the previous .<span class="caps">NET</span> course and chose to focus on the <span class="caps">LAMP</span> stack. Not too surprising for a Python guy, but <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/08/28/assembling-the-platform/">his next choice</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>I knew that Rails had the Basically Good, Basically Complete Web Framework with a Huge Community &#8211; Python will have one too. But I lost it when I found that Ruby has a standard build tool in Rake, a standard documentation tool that meets my needs in RDoc, and that Gems were everywhere. I had assumed that these would be no further developed than their analogs in the Python world.<br />
<br />
The long and short of it is that my evaluation turned into what looks to be a long term relationship. I&rsquo;m committed to my responsibilities on the Python projects I have going right now and I have a ton of existing applications and utilities written in Python that aren&rsquo;t going anywhere but Rails ganked 80% of my future code somehow.</blockquote>
<p>Back in the day when I came over from <span class="caps">PHP</span>, I had many of the same reservations regarding tools and libraries. That surely, Ruby would have less and worse than the reigning web champion. Surprise, surprise: I didn&#8217;t. And the rest is history.</p>
