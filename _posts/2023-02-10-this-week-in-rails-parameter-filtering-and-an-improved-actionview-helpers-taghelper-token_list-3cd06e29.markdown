Përshëndetje! [Emmanuel](https://manny.codes/about/) here with the usual stuff.  
  
[_filtered\_path_&nbsp;in _ActionController::Instrumentation_&nbsp;event payloads over _fullpath_](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47296)  
For security reasons, some data need to be filtered before it reaches bad actors. Rails now filters parameters in paths that may include sensitive information in logs. Instead of passing _fullpath_ to _ActionController::Instrumentation_, Rails now passes _filtered\_path_. Here's some code for the difference:  
  

    get "/posts?password=test"
     
      request.full_path # => "/posts?password=test"
      response.filtered_path # => "/posts?password=[FILTERED]"

  
[Guard Stimulus' data-action from multiple escapes](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47318)  
_ActionView::Helpers::TagHelper_'s _token\_list_ saw some improvements in this pull request. Previously, utilizing multiple consecutive calls to the _token\_list_ function with a _data-action_ attribute value caused an excess of HTML escapes. This has now been fixed.  
  
[Added option to show all headers for mailer previews](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47317)  
This pull request enhances the mailer preview template by introducing an expandable section. Upon expansion, the section displays a comprehensive table of all headers relevant to the mailer.  
  
[Stop logging filtered params in Action Cable](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47300)  
This pull request adds parameter filtering to filter out sensitive information that might be passed over WebSockets so logs won't leak out information.
