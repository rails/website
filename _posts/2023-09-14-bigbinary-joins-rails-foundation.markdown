Please help us welcome <a href="https://www.bigbinary.com">BigBinary</a> as the newest Contributing member of the Rails Foundation!

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-bigbinary.svg" style="width: 50%"></p>

For more than twelve years, BigBinary has built custom web applications for clients using Ruby on Rails. Recently, they also launched <a href="https://www.neeto.com">neeto</a>, an impressive suite of productivity tools all built on Rails. Over the past decade, the team has made many contributions to the Rails codebase and is active in the Rails community- organizing meet-ups, sponsoring events like Rails Girls, and speaking at various Ruby and Rails conferences around the world.

>At BigBinary, we all love working with Ruby on Rails, and find it incredibly productive. Without it, it wouldn't be possible for us to build neeto, where we are building 20+ products simultaneously. 
>We are thrilled to be part of the Rails Foundation. We believe Rails has a great future ahead and we want to do our bit to make that a reality.
><br><br>*Neeraj Singh, BigBinary Founder & CEO*

We are also excited about BigBinary’s emphasis on education, comprehensive documentation, and developer happiness, all of which led to the creation of <a href="https://courses.bigbinaryacademy.com/">BigBinary Academy</a>, <a href="https://courses.bigbinaryacademy.com/learn-rubyonrails/">Learn Ruby on Rails</a>, and tools such as <a href="https://neetocode.com/">neetoCode</a>. 

Documentation and education are two of the four main pillars on which the Rails Foundation was built, so we look forward to their insights, experience, and advice as we kick off our own initiatives (more on that soon!).

In the 20th anniversary of the framework, the future of Rails is bright thanks to partnerships like this, and we are proud to have BigBinary as a Contributing member.
