          Cookpad is the world’s largest recipe-sharing platform, where over 100
          million home cooks search, upload, and share their own recipes each
          month. Founded in Japan, it’s become a staple in millions of kitchens
          and has since expanded to more than 70 countries and 35 languages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally built on ColdFusion in 1997, Cookpad migrated to Ruby on
          Rails in 2007 to improve development speed, flexibility, and long-term
          maintainability. Today, Rails is still the backbone of Cookpad’s
          infrastructure, powering everything from recipe search to mobile APIs.

        <h2>Why Rails?</h2>

        <p>
          At Cookpad, new features are developed as experiments and validated
          through user feedback. But by the mid-2000s, their ColdFusion-based
          system was slowing them down. The codebase had become complex and
          difficult to maintain, making it hard to introduce new features or
          iterate quickly. They needed a framework that supported rapid
          experimentation without too much overhead, so they started looking for
          an alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2007, they decided to migrate to Rails. Even though no one on their
          team had prior experience with it, Rails’
          convention-over-configuration approach fit perfectly with their need
          for fast prototyping. Instead of spending time on setup and low-level
          implementation details, the team could focus on building, testing, and
          improving features based on user feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          That shift paid off quickly. Development sped up, releases became more
          frequent, and Cookpad was able to expand beyond Japan into 700
          countries and 35 languages. Just two years later, in 2009, the company
          went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, all with Rails quietly
          running under the hood.

        <h2>How Rails Powers Cookpad Today</h2>

        <p>
          Today, Cookpad mostly runs as a Rails monolith, with a few services
          extracted where it made sense (like search and payments). The same
          backend also serves as the API for both iOS and Android apps, which
          keeps development simpler, reduces redundancy, and keeps the user
          experience consistent across platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Cookpad’s workload is mostly read-heavy from users browsing
          recipes, database performance and scalability are critical, so Rails’
          seamless integration with MySQL on AWS RDS was a big factor in the
          team’s decision to choose the framework. To keep response times fast,
          they use Memcached and Redis to cache common queries and reduce
          database load. ActiveRecord’s query optimizations combined with
          careful indexing and eager loading help keep things responsive as
          traffic and the recipe catalog grows.
        </p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          For background jobs, Cookpad uses an event-driven setup built around
          Kafka (MSK). Tools like Karafka and Resque handle asynchronous tasks,
          so that resource-heavy operations don’t block user requests, keeping
          the platform fast and reliable as it scales.

        <p>Other key Rails features that help Cookpad scale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>ActiveRecord ORM</b> – Provides a structured way to work with
            databases, enabling engineers to handle a massive recipe catalog
            while maintaining performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Internationalization (I18n) support</b> – Baked-in localization
            features made it easier to expand into 70+ countries and 35+
            languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Template rendering system</b> – Keeps logic separate from
            presentation, making front-end updates cleaner and reducing
            development friction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Test-driven culture</b> – Encourages a quality-first approach,
            allowing Cookpad to deploy straight from the main branch multiple
            times per day with confidence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On the web, Cookpad leans on <b>Hotwire</b>, using Turbo and Stimulus
          controllers creating responsive, dynamic interfaces without relying on
          heavy JavaScript frameworks. This Rails-native approach makes the UI
          fast and flexible while letting the backend remain in control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rails’ conventions and cohesive tooling also make onboarding new
          engineers faster. Developers join the team and are immediately able to
          contribute meaningful work, often within days. Combined with tools
          like feature flags and a strong testing culture, Cookpad can
          experiment, evolve, and scale without fear of breaking things.

        <h2>Investing Back Into Rails</h2>

        <p>
          Cookpad hasn’t just used Rails, they’ve helped shape it. Over the
          years, they’ve employed members of the <b>Rails Core team</b> and
          supported Ruby directly by employing core maintainers Koichi Sasada
          and Yusuke Endoh for many years to work on the language, helping
          define and refine core features and performance across both
          ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’ve also released several <b>open-source tools</b>, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/chanko">chanko</a></b> – A
            feature flagging framework for gradually rolling out new features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/barbeque">barbeque</a></b> – A
            background job system built to manage large-scale workloads
            efficiently.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Beyond code, Cookpad engineers have often spoken at Rails conferences,
          contributed directly to Rails and Ruby, and improved widely used
          libraries. Today, Cookpad continues to invest in and support the
          long-term growth of the framework and its ecosystem as a
          <b>founding member of the Rails Foundation</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly two decades after their migration, Cookpad’s choice of Rails
          continues to pay off, providing the foundation for a fast, global, and
          resilient platform that keeps millions of home cooks connected every
          day.

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Fast, efficient iteration</b> – Rails provides a structured yet
          flexible foundation that lets Cookpad ship features quickly while
          maintaining stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Simple localization</b> – I18n support enables Cookpad to serve 70+
          countries and 35+ languages without excessive engineering effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Modern features, smooth adoption</b> – Built-in tools like Hotwire
          can be adopted incrementally to improve the user experience without
          major refactors.
