    - question: Will Rails World be livestreamed?
      answer: >
          Rails World will not be livestreamed, but we want those who cannot attend to have access to the sessions quickly, so we will publish the Opening Keynote within hours of it taking place. All other sessions will be online within two weeks after Rails World. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@railsofficial">Subscribe</a> to be informed when the videos get published.

    - question: Should I stay for the weekend after Rails World?
      answer: >
        Of course you should! Staying in Amsterdam longer is never a bad idea, and with 800 other community members coming to Rails World, it’s likely you will have plenty of company to explore the city with.

    - question: I am staying for the weekend. What can I see or do?
      answer: >
        There is a lot to see in Amsterdam, from the picturesque narrow houses to cruises in the canals via incredible museums. Our Platinum sponsor, AppSignal, will be sharing a guide on what to see and do while you are in their hometown. We'll share that here soon.

    - question: Where is the event taking place?
      answer: |-
        Rails World will be held at the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam. This historic building used to be the home of the stock exchange, and is located in the heart of the city.

    - question: How can I get to the venue?
      answer: |-
        Beurs van Berlage (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place//data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c609c787f17ca7:0xfdc6eede688a772f?sa=X&ved=1t:8290&ictx=111">Google maps</a>), is located precisely 7 minutes by walk from Amsterdam Centraal. If you are staying in Amsterdam we would recommend taking any tram or bus going towards the station, and walk from there.
        For more accurate traveling options, please make use of the 9292 travel planner app or Google maps.

    - question: Where should I stay?
      answer: |-
        We have secured event rates in two hotels in the city. Ticket holders will be sent details on how you can book these rates in their confirmation.
        We advise attendees to book as early as possible. While there are many hotels in Amsterdam, the rates are quite high averaging €200 - €350 per night.
        Luckily, Amsterdam is a small city and easily accessible by bike, public transportation, or walking, so no matter where you stay in the city you won’t be far from the event venue.

- category: Accessibility

    - question: How can I communicate my accessibility needs to the organisation?
      answer: >
        Rails World is committed to making the event accessible to everyone. If you have specific accessibility needs or require any accommodations, please us know on the registration form, and we will do our best to accommodate you.

    - question: Will the conference be accessible by wheelchair?
      answer: >
        Yes, the Beurs van Berlage is wheelchair accessible, and wheelchair users can expect to use the lifts for:
          - Entering from the street to the lobby.
          - Descending to level -1 where the restrooms and cloakroom are located.
          - Ascending to the first floor where the workshops are held.
          - All other programmed activity will take place on the ground level after you enter through the lobby.

    - question: How much walking will be required?
      answer: >
        While the building is fairly long, most of the program will take place on two tracks and in the Sponsor Lounge, the entries of which are all located closely together; meaning walking can be kept to a minimum if need be. There will be plenty of seating throughout the space to relax.
        Attending workshops will require a longer distance, as they are located one floor higher at the end of the building. As an indication, the longest room is 45 meters long.

    - question: Will the talks have closed captioning?
      answer: |-
        There will be closed caption screens to the left and right of the stages for those who need it.

    - question: Are food and drinks included? Can dietary requirements be accommodated?
      answer: |-
        The following will be available at the venue:

        - lunch on both days sponsored by Codeminer42
        - snack breaks
        - all-day non-alcoholic drinks and coffee

  topics:

    - question: Where will the Rails at Scale Summit take place?
      answer: >
        We have secured a venue in Amsterdam Noord within easy access to the conference hotel(s), and invited attendees will be sent location details with their registration.
        
    - question: What constitutes "at scale"?
      answer: >
        If you're tackling performance bottlenecks, scaling databases, managing high volumes of traffic, or optimizing large codebases, we'd love
        to hear from you. "At scale" could refer to the number of Rails devs on your team, or the number of applications/services you are working with.

    - question: What topics will be covered?
      answer: >
        The agenda will be shaped around the challenges and interests of the attendees. Once applications are reviewed,
        we'll tailor the content to address the most relevant topics for the group.

    - question: Who should attend?
      answer: >
        Consider bringing/sending a staff (or senior) engineer who spends significant time on the code solving these problems, or someone who can speak on behalf of your company’s engineering team. 

    - question: Content will not be recorded.
      answer: >
        To encourage open and candid discussion, all attendees will be asked to sign an NDA, and no talks will be recorded.

    - question: How much are tickets?
      answer: >
        We are pricing out tickets and will publish this shortly. Good to know: Rails at Scale tickets do not include access to Rails World. Rails World tickets will be sold separately.
