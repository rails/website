Full stack developer with over 17 years of professional experience solving problems with Software, mainly with Ruby and Rails. Author of "Master Hotwire" e-book. I split my time between coding the backend of (mostly complex) applications and leading and increasing efficiency of a team of developers. I am bullish on Hotwire approach.
