Harassment of any kind, including offensive comments, intimidation, unwanted attention, or disruptive behavior, will not be tolerated in any conference space.

We value diversity, collaboration, and respect for all community members, and we will ensure Rails World remains a safe space, free from harassment of any kind.

We expect from everyone participating in Rails World activities, including online discussions and platforms, in-person events, and any other interactions within our community to adhere to the following code of conduct.

## Code of Conduct ##

As a Rails World participant, I will:

* Treat others with respect, kindness, and empathy.

* Contribute to a harassment-free, inclusive environment.

* Communicate thoughtfully, even in disagreement.

* Be open to different ideas, perspectives, and opinions, even if they differ from my own.

* Report any inappropriate behavior to Rails World staff.

## Enforcement ##

Anyone violating this code may be warned or removed from the conference without refund. If you experience or witness harassment, please contact a staff member (wearing Staff shirts or at Registration/Info Desk) or email [world@rubyonrails.org](mailto:world@rubyonrails.org).
