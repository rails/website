        <span class="bold">Rails at Scale</span> is a day of open discussion about scaling Rails applications. It’s where engineers working
        on high-performance, high-traffic systemscan connect and exchange insights, best practices, and hard-earned lessons.
      </p>

      <p><span class="bold">Expect to:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn from engineers who have scaled Rails in production</li>
        <li>Share your own insights in open discussions</li>
        <li>Connect with engineers solving similar challenges at other companies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We encourage applications from anyone working with Rails at scale. However, this is an invite-only event capped
        at 100 attendees, so space is limited. We will therefore need to limit the number of attendees from any one company.
        Applicants are asked to apply on behalf of their company and indicate how many people they would like to send.
      </p>

      <p>We will review all applications and select those who best align with the event's focus.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Apply to attend</span> and be part of the conversation.</p>
