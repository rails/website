## Our Pledge ##

We, the Rails World organizers, will do our utmost best to maintain the Rails Code of Conduct found [here](https://rubyonrails.org/conduct). However, we would also like to be explicit in how this translates into an in-person event.

We value diversity, collaboration, and respect for all community members, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, and we will ensure Rails World remains a safe space, free from harassment of any kind.

Harassment is a broad term, and includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual language or imagery in public or private conference spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, trolling, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

We expect from everyone participating in Rails World activities, including online discussions and platforms, in-person events, and any other interactions within our community to adhere to the following code of conduct.
<br>

## Code of Conduct ##

As a Rails World attendee, I pledge to:

* Treat all community members with respect, kindness, and empathy.

* Be mindful of the impact my words and actions may have on others and strive to create an environment free from harassment, discrimination, and intimidation.

* Foster an open and welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels safe and comfortable to participate.

* Be open to different ideas, perspectives, and opinions, even if they differ from my own.

* Encourage and support newcomers by providing guidance and constructive feedback.

* Refrain from engaging in any form of offensive, disrespectful, or harassing behavior.

* Engage in thoughtful, constructive, and respectful communication with fellow community members, even when disagreeing.

* Be considerate and patient when offering or seeking assistance.

* Immediately contact Rails World staff if I see inappropriate or harassing behavior amongst other attendees.
<br>

## Enforcement ##

If a Rails World attendee, speaker, sponsor, or conference staff member engages in harassing behavior, we will take any action we deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Rails World with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please find a Rails World staff member immediately - they will be identifiable by their Staff shirts, or easily found at the Registration or Information desk.

You can also email [world@rubyonrails.org](mailto:world@rubyonrails.org) with your concerns.
