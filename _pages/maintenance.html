        <h3 id="new_features">New Features</h3>
        <p>We aim to release a version containing new features every six months. In the rare case where
          no release was made in one year, we will extend the support period for the previous release
          until the next release is made.</p>
        <h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>
        <p>Minor releases will receive bug fixes for one year after the first release in
          its series. For example, if a theoretical 1.1.0 is released on January 1, 2023, it
          will receive bug fixes until January 1, 2024. After that, it will be considered
          unsupported.</p>
        <h6>List of currently supported releases</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>8.0.x</strong> - Supported until November 7, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>7.2.x</strong> - Supported until August 9, 2025</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="security">Security Issues</h3>
        <p>
          Minor releases will receive security fixes for two years after the first release in
          its series. For example, if a theoretical 1.1.0 is released on January 1, 2023, it
          will receive security fixes until January 1, 2025. After that, it will reach its
          end-of-life.

        <h3 id="unsupported">Unsupported Release Series</h3>
        <p>When a release series is no longer supported, it’s your own responsibility to deal with bugs and security issues. We may provide backports of the fixes and publish them to git, however there will be no new versions released. If you are not comfortable maintaining your own versions, you should upgrade to a supported version.</p>
