        <h3>So, who's responsible for your personal information?</h3>
        <p>That's us – the Rails Foundation (the data controller). We control, manage, and decide how we use your personal information as part of our business activities.</p> 

        <p>If you choose to provide your personal information to other parties during an event organized by the Rails Foundation, including sponsors, then their data privacy policies apply to the data that you give to them.</p>

        <p>However, we will take all reasonable measures to ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal information are also compliant with data protection laws and have appropriate safeguards in place to protect your personal information.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />

        <h3>What kind of personal information do we collect?</h3> 

        <p>It includes but is not limited to your full name, email address, contact information, company/organization info, photos and biographies (for conference speakers), contact preference information, dietary preferences, and any other information related to you or anyone else you may provide to us. If you provide us with information about a third party, you must have their consent to share it and let them know about this privacy policy.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />

        <h3>Use of third party services.</h3>
        <p>The Rails Foundation uses some third-party services like Basecamp, Hey, and Tito for project management, email services, and Rails World registration (respectively).</p>

        <p>If their privacy policy is more restrictive than ours, we'll follow their terms. 
        Read more about their policies here:
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://basecamp.com/about/policies/privacy">Basecamp</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.hey.com/policies/privacy/">Hey</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ti.to/privacy">Tito</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>We make sure that any vendors we work with are also compliant with data protection laws and have appropriate safeguards in place to protect your personal information.</p>

        <h3>Sensitive or special categories of information.</h3>

        <h5>Sensitive information.</h5>
        <p>Some personal information is particularly sensitive, like ethnicity, nationality, gender, and other demographic information, and we only collect this data when you voluntarily give it to us. We don't share anyone's sensitive information with third parties unless required by law or with explicit opt-in consent from the individual.</p>

        <h5>Website usage and info.</h5>
        <p>The Rails Foundation collects information when you provide it to us, such as when you email us information, connect with us on social media, use the suggestion form found on our website, subscribe to our mailing lists, or when you engage in any other communication, recorded or otherwise communicated.</p>

        <h5>Cookies.</h5>
        <p>The Rails Foundation is committed to ensuring the privacy of our website visitors. To achieve this, we use Plausible as our web analytics tool.</p>

        <p>Plausible's primary goal is to track overall trends in website traffic, not individual visitors. Therefore, they do not use cookies or generate persistent identifiers, and they do not collect or store any personal or identifiable data. All data collected is aggregated data only, and it contains no personal information.</p>

        <p>Using Plausible Analytics ensures that all site measurements are carried out anonymousl, and only the most essential data points are measured, and nothing else.</p>

        <p>Read Plausible’s data policy <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">here</a>.</p>

        <h5>Speaker or author information.</h5>
        <p>If you choose to author a written resource, including a mailing list post, blog post, or guide, or if you choose to speak at Rails World (both live and recorded for further broadcasting), you may be required to provide minimal biographical information or links to your social network or GitHub account to associate with your presentation or materials. As part of your agreement to participate, you acknowledge and agree that this information will remain publicly available for purposes of proper attribution of your work and maintenance of the historical record.</p>

        <h3>How do we obtain your information?</h3>
        <p>As stated previously, we collect information from you when you contact the foundation or register for an event. This includes subscribing to our mailing list, contacting us through our website, suggestion form, or email, and registering for an event.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />

        <h3>How do we use the information that we collect?</h3>
        <p></p>At Rails Foundation, we take your personal information seriously, and we only collect it for specific reasons. Here are some of the reasons we ask for your info:
        <ul>
        <li>To enroll you in Rails Foundation-related mailings to keep you informed about Ruby on Rails, Rails Foundation, and events within Rails World, but only if you opt-in.</li>
            <li>To register you for events, tutorials, and other services, so you can participate in them.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you and answer any questions you may have.</li>
            <li>To process your payment for Rails Foundation services and events.</li>
            <li>To prevent and detect fraud.</li>
            <li>To protect and enforce our legal rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We only collect and use your personal information for legitimate business purposes, or to perform a contract between you and us. We may ask for your consent in certain circumstances where applicable law requires it.</p> 

        <hr class="divider" />
        <h3>Who do we share your personal information with?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, we need to share your personal information with third-party service providers to provide services you have opted into, for instance onsite event registration. We will never, ever sell your information.</p>

        <p>In some cases, we may need to disclose your personal information to protect our rights, property, or other website users. We may also disclose your information if required by law or in response to an emergency situation. We want to make sure you're aware that if you choose not to provide us with your personal information, you may not be able to access certain activities, like an event.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />
        <h3>Transfer of personal information across borders.</h3>
        <p>The Rails Foundation is a US-based organization, but we work with third-party service providers and employees both in the United States and in other countries to provide our services to you. This means that your personal information may be transferred from one country to another.</p>

        <p>It's important to note that the laws and regulations around privacy and data protection can be different in different countries. This means that the overseas entities that we share your information with may not be subject to the same laws as your country of residence or employment. Where we transfer information outside of the European Economic Areas, we will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains protected and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Where our third-party service providers process personal data outside the European Economic Area in the course of providing services to us, our written agreement with them will include appropriate measures, usually EU standard contractual clauses (as contemplated by Article 46(2) of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation).</p>

        <p>Once we receive your personal information, we use appropriate security features to prevent unauthorized access. If you have any concerns or questions about how we protect your personal information, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us (see the section below titled "Contacting the Rails Foundation with Questions, Concerns, or Complaints").</p>

        <hr class="divider" />
        <h3>Your rights, including removing, correcting, or updating personal information.</h3>
        <p>At the Rails Foundation, we want to make sure that you have control over your personal information. If you change your mind about how we use your data, or if you need to update your contact information, please let us know and we'll do our best to help.</p>

        <p>If you're a citizen of California, the European Union, or the European Economic Area, you may have additional rights regarding your personal information. These rights include the right to access, rectify, or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict its use, port it to another service, or object to its use. You can also withdraw your consent for us to use your information and file a complaint with the relevant data protection authority.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions about your rights or want to exercise them, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@rubyonrails.org">info@rubyonrails.org</a>.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that some information, like your name associated with a talk you gave, may not be able to be deleted if it's been made publicly available.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />
        <h3>How long will we keep your personal information.</h3>
        <p>We will keep your personal information for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />
