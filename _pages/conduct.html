        <p>Rails follows <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/">the Ruby guidelines for conduct</a> in all collaborative spaces, such as mailing lists, submitted patches, commit comments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participants are expected to be tolerant of opposing views.</li>
          <li>Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free from personal attacks and disparaging remarks.</li>
          <li>When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.</li>
          <li>Behavior that could reasonably be considered harassment will not be tolerated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you believe these guidelines have been violated, you can email conduct@rubyonrails.org to alert The Rails Foundation.</p>
