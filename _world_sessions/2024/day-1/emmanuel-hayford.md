Explore the evolving world of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), built with familiar Rails technologies and designed for seamless use in all compatible browsers. Rails 8 promises to simplify PWA development, offering ways to swiftly generate essential PWA scaffolding.

This talk covers PWA basics and Rails 8's crucial development role. We'll examine the service worker lifecycle, offline strategies via background sync, and the CacheStorage API for cross-device performance.

Additionally, we'll investigate local data storage via IndexedDB and exploiting Push Notifications to elevate the user experience to that of native applications.
