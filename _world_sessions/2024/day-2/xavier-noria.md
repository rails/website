In this talk we'll cover what happens when a Rails application boots. When is the logger ready? When is $LOAD_PATH set? When do initializers run or when are the autoloaders are set up? Basically, we'll understand what runs when. Also, we'll understand railties and engines initializers, which are key to this process.
