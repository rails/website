In this talk you’ll learn how to push the boundaries with ActiveStorage and leverage it to build feature rich user experiences. You’ll learn how to build custom services to integrate with external providers that go above and beyond the built in services to allow users to select images from a third party API that hosts images for you, and a rich media library that allows users to see, modify and upload files they’ve uploaded that can be selected from in forms in place of uploading a new file.
