Are you ready to rev­o­lu­tion­ize your cod­ing en­vi­ron­ment? In a world dom­i­nat­ed by VS Code and oth­er Elec­tron-based ed­i­tors, there’s a hid­den gem that de­vel­op­ers are redis­cov­er­ing: Vim. Or rather, Neovim. Just as Rails trans­formed web de­vel­op­ment, Neovim is re­defin­ing how we write code, blend­ing decades-old tech­nol­o­gy with modern tool­ing for an un­par­al­leled ex­pe­ri­ence.

**Work­shop over­view**
In this hands-on work­shop, we dive into the world of Neovim and Zel­lij — show­ing you how to stream­line your de­vel­op­ment process and achieve a true flow state.

**Here’s what you can ex­pect**

- In­tro­duc­tion to Neovim: Un­der­stand the core prin­ci­ples that make Neovim a game-chang­er in the mod­ern pro­gram­ming land­scape.
- Learn how to ef­fort­less­ly man­age and cus­tomize plu­g­ins to suit your unique work­flow, shed­ding the bloat of heav­ier ed­i­tors.
- Com­bine the pow­er of Neovim and Zel­lij to in­crease de­vel­op­er pro­duc­tiv­ity by achiev­ing your op­ti­mal flow state.

**Key take­aways**
By the end of this 75-minute work­shop, you will:

- Have a sol­id un­der­stand­ing of Neovim’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties and how it can enhance your pro­duc­tiv­i­ty.
- Man­age work­spaces us­ing Zel­lij to jump in and out of projects with ease.
- Walk away with a Neovim set­up that em­pow­ers you to code with min­i­mal dis­trac­tions, max­i­miz­ing your ef­fi­cien­cy and cre­ativ­i­ty.

**Why At­tend?**
This work­shop is per­fect for de­vel­op­ers of all lev­els (with some fa­mil­iar­i­ty with Vim) who are look­ing to op­ti­mize their work­flow and em­brace a light­weight, pow­er­ful, and high­ly cus­tomizable ed­i­tor. Whether you’re new to Neovim or look­ing to deep­en your un­der­stand­ing, this ses­sion will pro­vide you with prac­ti­cal skills and in­sights that you can ap­ply im­me­di­ate­ly.
