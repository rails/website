One of Hotwire's most requested features is offline mode. This topic has been the source of frequent headaches at 37signals, as we went through different custom solutions, each with its own set of challenges. This year, we decided to do something about it by adding offline support to Hotwire using service workers. They have long been the answer to this for PWAs, but they're full of gotchas, and making them work correctly in Hotwire Native apps is not an easy task. In this talk, we'll learn about all those gotchas, how we've worked around them and what the plans for Hotwire offline are.
