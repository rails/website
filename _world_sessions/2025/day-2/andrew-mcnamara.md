Discover how to build flexible, scalable AI agents in Rails through modular components
that adapt to the evolving AI landscape. Learn practical patterns for abstracting model
providers, implementing flow-based architectures, building flexible tools, and managing
prompts. We'll explore how to handle divergent LLM provider features, plus key AI
learnings: evaluation strategies for large applications, deciding between agents vs tools
(A2A/MCP), and choosing between fine-tuning vs prompt engineering. Perfect for
developers integrating AI or scaling existing implementations.
