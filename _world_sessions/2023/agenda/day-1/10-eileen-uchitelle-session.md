Today we're going to explore the magic of Rails. We'll look at the philosophy behind the framework as well as the overall structure of the components. We'll explore some of the common patterns that Rails uses to build agnostic and beautiful interfaces, and the techniques it implements to hide complexity so you can focus building your application. By the end of this talk you'll feel more confident navigating the Rails codebase and better understand the patterns it uses to create the framework we all know and love. But Rails is so much more than its design and architecture. We'll dive into my motivations for working on the framework and why the community is so important to the long term success of Rails.
